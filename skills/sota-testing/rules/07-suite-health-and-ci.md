# 07 — Suite Health & CI

A test suite is a production system with an SLO: fast, deterministic signal
on every change. This file is about keeping it one.

## 7.1 Flaky-test policy

A flaky test (same code, different outcomes) is worse than a missing test: it
costs run time, destroys trust in red, and trains retry-until-green — which
also masks *real* intermittent bugs, the most expensive kind.

**The policy (write it down, automate what you can):**

1. **Detect**: track per-test pass/fail history across CI runs (most CI/test
   platforms can; minimum viable = parse JUnit XML into a dashboard). A test
   that fails then passes on retry with no code change is flagged
   automatically.
2. **Quarantine within a day, not debate**: move the flagged test to a
   non-blocking quarantine lane (still runs, never gates merges). Quarantine
   entry REQUIRES: a ticket, an owner, and an **expiry date** (e.g. 14–30
   days). The worst steady-state is a permanent quarantine pile — that's
   deleting tests with extra steps.
3. **Root-cause with the taxonomy** — the fix differs by class:
   - **Ordering/isolation**: passes alone, fails in suite (shared state,
     leaked globals, DB residue). Fix via `rules/02` §2.5 / `rules/03` §3.6.
     Repro: run shuffled / run the failing pair alone.
   - **Async/race**: fixed sleeps, unawaited promises, racing a spinner,
     assertion before settle. Fix via `rules/02` §2.6, `rules/05` §5.3.
   - **Time**: real clocks, midnight/DST/month boundaries, timeout tuned to
     a fast machine. Fix: inject clock; never assert wall-clock durations —
     **except where the deadline itself is the behaviour under test.** A
     timeout, a cancellation, a kill-on-drop or a watchdog has no oracle other
     than elapsed time: injecting the clock tests the arithmetic and says
     nothing about whether the deadline *fires*. Assert those with an
     **order-of-magnitude** margin rather than a percentage one — a 300 ms
     budget asserted at `< 5 s` leaves a ~16x cushion, and one such
     assertion caught a real case measured at **30.28 s**, where a grandchild
     holding an inherited pipe kept the wait alive (`sota-sandboxing` rules/04
     R5.3a). The flake this bullet is about is a *percentage* margin on shared
     infrastructure; two orders of magnitude is not that.
   - **Infra/environment**: port collisions, disk full, container pull
     flakes, third-party sandbox blips. Fix in harness/CI, not the test.
   - **Test bug**: nondeterministic data (unseeded random, map ordering),
     overspecified assertion. Fix the test.
   - **Real bug**: the code IS intermittently wrong (race in prod code).
     The flake was the alarm — escalate, don't quarantine the alarm.
4. **At expiry**: fixed and re-promoted, or deleted with rationale. No third
   state.
5. **Retries**: at most one auto-retry, with both outcomes recorded and
   feeding the detector. Retry-to-green WITHOUT tracking is the suite
   silently rotting; blanket `retries: 3` to "stabilize CI" is a High
   finding wherever you see it.

```python
# BAD — permanent amnesty; nothing tracks it, nothing expires it
@pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=3)
def test_checkout_updates_inventory(): ...

# GOOD — quarantined: out of the gate, owned, dated, classified
@pytest.mark.quarantine(ticket="QA-1432", owner="payments-team",
                        expires="2026-07-01", cause="async")  # CI fails the
def test_checkout_updates_inventory(): ...                    # build past expiry
```

## 7.2 Coverage philosophy

Coverage measures what tests *execute*, not what they *verify* (an
assertion-free test covers everything it touches — `rules/02` §2.7; mutation
testing measures verification — `rules/06` §6.3).

- **Use coverage as a gap-finder**: the uncovered-lines report on YOUR diff
  is genuinely useful — it shows the error path you forgot. Read it per-PR.
- **Branch coverage over line coverage** where the tooling offers it: line
  coverage credits `if err != nil` lines without ever taking the branch.
- **Never set a global percentage target.** Goodhart's law is undefeated:
  targets manufacture assertion-light tests on easy code while risky code
  stays bare. 80% chosen-by-committee says nothing — the *which* 20% is
  everything.
- **Ratchet instead of threshold**: fail CI only if coverage *decreases*
  (with small tolerance), or apply a diff-coverage rule ("changed lines ≥ X%")
  so the bar applies to new work without backfill theater. Ratchets create
  pressure exactly where code is being touched.

```text
BAD:  fail_under = 80            # global target → gamed on easy code,
                                 # ignored on risky code, fought at 79.9
GOOD: diff-coverage: changed lines >= 85% branch coverage   AND
      ratchet: total branch coverage >= last main build - 0.1%
      (stored number auto-raises; lowering it requires a reviewed commit)
```
- Exclude generated/vendored code from measurement; measuring it inflates
  the number and buries the signal. Same for the environment-bound shell that
  unit tests cannot drive (GUI, device, process-spawn adapters) — but the fix
  there is architectural: make that boundary explicit and keep it thin
  (`sota-architecture` rules/02 §14), then measure the core.
- **Rank the gaps by risk, not by size of deficit.** Coverage alone cannot say
  where the next test belongs. Cross it with complexity: a module that is both
  **branch-dense and thinly covered** is the highest-value target, and the
  composite (complexity weighted by how little of it is verified) ranks work
  better than either number alone. A 200-branch payment router at 50% is a
  finding; a 3-line getter at 0% is not. Use the ranking to aim mutation runs
  (`rules/06` §6.3) and review attention — as a *pointer*, never as a gate,
  or it becomes the same Goodhart target as a coverage threshold.
- Reporting coverage in PRs: show the uncovered lines, not just the delta
  percentage — reviewers act on lines, not numbers.

## 7.3 Speed budgets

Slow suites change behavior: engineers batch changes, skip running tests
locally, and context-switch during CI — each worse for quality than any
individual missing test.

Set explicit budgets per layer and enforce them like perf SLOs:

- **Unit suite**: fast enough to run on every save for the module you're
  editing (sub-second per module; whole unit suite minutes at most, fully
  parallel).
- **PR pipeline (test stages total)**: ~10 minutes wall-clock is the
  long-standing target that keeps PRs flowing; parallelize/shard to hold it
  as the suite grows rather than letting it drift to 40.
- **Track the top-10 slowest tests** per suite (every runner can emit
  timings) and treat a new entrant like a perf regression: push it down a
  layer, fix its waits, or justify it.
- Standard speed sinks, in order of yield: hard sleeps (`rules/02`/`05`),
  per-test container/app boot instead of per-suite (`rules/04` §4.1),
  serialized DB tests that could namespace, e2e tests that should be API
  tests, unbatched fixture I/O.
- **Nightly is not a landfill**: slow-but-valuable jobs (long PBT runs, fuzz,
  mutation, full-matrix, soak) belong post-merge/nightly — but each needs an
  owner who triages failures next morning, or it's a dead letter queue.

## 7.4 Parallelization correctness

Parallel execution is the main speed lever and the main isolation auditor —
a suite that can't run parallel is telling you it has shared state.

- **Design for parallel from test #1**: unique-per-test data (`rules/03`
  §3.6), no fixed ports (ask the OS for ephemeral ports / let the container
  lib assign), no shared temp paths (per-test temp dirs from the framework),
  no env-var mutation without scoped isolation (process-level env is shared
  across threads — prefer config injection over env mutation entirely).
- **Know your runner's model** (process-per-worker vs threads vs both —
  detail in language skills) — "thread-safe enough" fixtures that share a
  DB schema across workers serialize or corrupt. Pair worker-scoped
  resources (one schema per worker) with test-scoped isolation inside them.
- **Singletons and static caches** in production code surface here: if the
  SUT caches global state, tests must be able to construct isolated
  instances. "Reset the singleton between tests" is a workaround; injectable
  construction is the fix.
- Verify continuously: run shuffled AND parallel in CI (`rules/02` §2.5).
  Failures unique to parallel runs **within one suite invocation** are isolation
  bugs, never "just rerun".
- **Two independent runs are a different case, with the opposite answer — and the
  bullet above will point you the wrong way if you read it unscoped.** Everything in
  §7.4 is about workers *inside one invocation*, which share a codebase and are
  yours to isolate. Two whole suites against one shared database, broker or container
  runtime contend on state **neither run owns**, so the resulting failures are
  artifacts, and re-running the failing subset in isolation is the correct diagnosis
  rather than the forbidden one. This is increasingly common: CI plus a local run,
  a teammate on the same shared instance, or **two agent sessions on one machine**.
  Field-reported 2026-09-10 — a lane read 38,833 passed / **12 failed** / 60 skipped
  against a baseline of 38,875 / 0 / 30; a second session was running the same repo's
  suite unfiltered against the same container, clearing the graph underneath it. All
  256 tests in the three failing files then passed in isolation, and the clean re-run
  read 38,890 / 0 / 30.
- **Establish that yours is the only run touching the shared services before believing
  any failure — by parentage, not by process name**, since both runs match the same
  name and the same command line: `ps -Ao pid=,ppid=,command=`, then check which ppid
  each belongs to. (Same instrument, same reason, as shell-scripting guidance and `rules/03` §3a.) **A skip count that moved is the tell**: skips doubling
  alongside the failures says the *environment* changed, not the code — a service the
  suite conditionally needs went away. Compare failures *and* skips against the
  baseline, never failures alone.

## 7.5 CI sharding and pipeline shape

- **Shard by measured timing, not file count**: balanced shards by recorded
  per-test duration keep the long pole short; naive alphabetical splits give
  you one 12-minute shard and five 2-minute ones. Most ecosystems have
  timing-based splitters; persist timing data between runs.
- **Stage by speed and signal**: lint/type/unit first (fail in 2 min),
  integration next, e2e last (or post-merge beyond the smoke set —
  `rules/05` §5.7). A pipeline that runs e2e before unit wastes its fastest
  signal.
- **Test selection** (running only tests affected by the diff) is a real
  lever in monorepos — build-graph based selection (Bazel-style, Nx-style)
  is reliable; heuristic selection needs a periodic full run as a safety
  net (e.g. full suite on merge to main, selected on PR).
- **The merge queue / main must run the full blocking suite.** Skipping on
  "it passed on the PR branch" breaks under concurrent merges (semantic
  conflicts between independently-green PRs).
- Cache dependency/image layers, never test *results* across code changes
  unless keyed by a content hash you trust (build systems that hash inputs
  may; hand-rolled "skip if green yesterday" may not).

## 7.6 Failure triage discipline

A red main/merge-queue is a site incident for the team's delivery:

- **Red main stops the line**: fix-forward or revert within a defined window
  (e.g. 30 min); reverting an innocent-looking PR is cheaper than a day of
  everyone rebasing onto broken.
- **Every CI failure gets classified**, even (especially) the rerun-and-it-
  passed ones: real bug / flaky test / infra. The classification feeds the
  flake detector (7.1) and the infra backlog. "Reran, green, moved on" with
  no record is how suites rot invisibly.
- **Failure output must be diagnosable from CI alone**: assertion diffs, SUT
  logs, artifacts (`rules/05` §5.7). A failure that requires local repro to
  understand multiplies triage cost by 10.
- **Don't normalize deviance**: a permanently-yellow optional job, a
  `continue-on-error` on a once-important suite, a skipped-tests count
  drifting upward (`grep -rc 'skip\|xfail\|todo(' tests/` trending) — each
  is a finding. Skips need the same ticket+expiry discipline as quarantine.
- Weekly suite-health review (10 min): flake list vs expiry, slowest-10,
  quarantine size, skip count, coverage ratchet position. Suites stay
  healthy by inspection, not by hope.

## 7.7 A long run's result is scoped to the revision it started from

A suite that takes forty minutes reports on the tree **as it was when it started**, and the
number carries no hint of that. Field-reported: a lane reported **38,861 passed, EXIT=0** —
true of a working tree that predated a later commit by ~50 minutes. Arithmetic predicted
38,862, and the missing one was exactly the test that commit added.

- **Record the revision beside the number**, always: `git rev-parse HEAD` at start, printed
  in the same line as the result. "Green" is not a fact about your branch; "green at `<sha>`"
  is (`sota/rules/03` §2).
- **Reconcile the count against the diff.** An unexplained ±1 is a signal, not noise — the
  case above was only visible because the delta was *attributed* rather than accepted. Off
  by one in the other direction is a test that silently stopped being collected, which
  presents identically.
- **A background job's completion notification is about the launcher, not the job**
  (shell-scripting guidance). Wait on an artefact the job itself writes.

## 7.8 When a ratchet fires, the fix is never to re-record the ratchet

A ratchet exists to make a number only move one way. Its failure message almost always
offers the re-record command, which is the one action that destroys the signal — and it is
offered at exactly the moment the ratchet is doing its job.

Field-reported: a skip-site ratchet correctly caught a newly added `pytest.skip`. Re-recording
was offered and would have been wrong; reading the flagged code showed the branch was
**unreachable** — the parameter it skipped is not in the map it parametrizes over — so the
fix was deleting dead code. *An inert branch, shipped inside a guard written during an
inert-control audit.*

- **Read the flagged site before touching the baseline.** Re-record only after establishing
  that the new value is correct, and say why in the commit that moves it.
- **A ratchet compares against its own stored state, never against prose.** So a count
  quoted in a doc drifts freely while the suite stays green: field-reported, a matrix figure
  quoted as 209 where the function returns 207, and a CWE count stated as 41 in two places
  and 43 in another, the derived truth being 43. **Derive the number in a test whose failure
  message names every place that quotes it** — then the prose is inside the ratchet instead
  of beside it.

## 7.9 A threshold measured on one population, asserted over a pooled one

§7.8 covers what to do when a ratchet fires. This is the case where it fires for a
reason that **is not a regression at all**: the threshold was measured on the data
available at the time, and is then asserted over whatever the denominator later
contains. Add a legitimate new data source — a new corpus, language, tenant, region,
customer — and the control goes red with **no code change**, naming a regression that
did not happen.

Field-reported 2026-09-10. A recall control required a pre-LLM gate to reject ≥ 1.5%
of adjudicated false positives; the floor was measured at 3.9% on a 205-row,
JavaScript-derived corpus. A campaign against a Go target then contributed 491 false
positives and 0 rejections:

| population | rejected / FPs | share |
|---|--:|--:|
| tar-4.4.13 | 9/120 | 7.5% |
| axios-0.21.0 | 3/99 | 3.0% |
| handlebars-4.1.2 | 5/291 | 1.7% |
| markdown-it-12.3.1 | 0/202 | 0.0% |
| **a Go target** | **0/491** | **0.0%** |
| pooled | 17/1203 | **1.4%** ← fired |
| same corpus, minus the new population | 17/712 | **2.4%** ← passes |

Nothing was inert; the rules were authored from JavaScript category errors and simply
do not fire on Go. **No source line changed** — the gate module had been untouched for
eight days.

- **When such a control fires, decompose the denominator before believing its message.**
  The failure text said *"a family has probably gone inert"* — and dilution is the one
  cause a pooled metric **cannot** distinguish from the cause its author imagined. A
  failure message is a hypothesis written before the failure, not a diagnosis.
- **Assert per population, not over a pool**, wherever populations can differ in kind:
  `max(share) >= floor` over populations above a minimum sample size (≥ 50 here). That
  still fails when the property dies *everywhere* — which is what "has gone inert"
  means — and cannot fail merely because data was added. Prove both directions with a
  mutation (`rules/06` §6.3): break one population and watch it stay green, break all of them and
  watch it go red.
- **Lowering the floor is re-recording a ratchet** (§7.8). If the honest answer is that
  the property does not hold on the new population, that is a finding about **scope**,
  not a smaller number — and it belongs in the control's name.
- **State the population a threshold was measured on next to the constant, in code.** A
  floor whose provenance lives only in a commit message will be lowered by whoever
  meets it next, because nothing on the line tells them what it meant.

## 7.10 A PR that deletes, skips or weakens tests needs a human sign-off

The cheapest way to turn a red test green is to delete it, skip it or drop its
assertion. A coding agent told to "make CI pass" finds that route readily
(`sota-llm-engineering` rules/04 §3a). A reviewer skimming a large diff misses it just
as readily, because a removed line is shorter than an added one. Make the diff say so:
a PR check that counts removed test definitions, newly added skips and the net
assertion delta in test files, and routes any hit to a required human approval.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
base=$(git merge-base "${BASE_REF:-origin/main}" HEAD)
d=$(git diff -U0 "$base" HEAD -- '*test*' '*spec*')
count() { printf '%s\n' "$d" | grep -cE "$1" || true; }   # grep -c exits 1 on zero
removed=$(count '^-[[:space:]]*(async def test_|def test_|func Test|@Test|(it|test)\()')
skipped=$(count '^\+.*(pytest\.mark\.(skip|xfail)|pytest\.skip\(|unittest\.skip|t\.Skip|@Disabled|@Ignore|(it|test|describe)\.skip\(|xit\()')
a_plus=$(count '^\+[^+].*(assert|expect\(|t\.(Error|Fatal))')
a_minus=$(count '^-[^-].*(assert|expect\(|t\.(Error|Fatal))')
echo "removed-tests=$removed added-skips=$skipped assertions=+$a_plus/-$a_minus"
if (( removed > 0 || skipped > 0 || a_minus > a_plus )); then
  echo "needs human sign-off: tests removed, skipped or weakened" >&2; exit 1
fi
```

Run against a PR that deleted a Python and a Go test, skipped a pytest and a Jest
case and dropped an assertion, it printed `removed-tests=3 added-skips=2
assertions=+0/-3` and exited 1. A PR that only added a test exited 0. It is a
**flag, not a verdict**. A moved or renamed test also counts as removed, and a
deleted redundant test is legitimate (§7.1 step 4). Adjust the patterns to your
runners, and make the gate's failure mean "a named human approves", never "blocked".
Security test files (`rules/09`) deserve a code-owner rule of their own. OWASP:

## Audit checklist

- [ ] **Suite failures: was yours the only run touching the shared services?** (§7.4)
      Two independent runs against one DB/broker/container produce failures that are
      artifacts, and the parallel-isolation rule does **not** apply to them. Check
      parentage (`ps -Ao pid=,ppid=,command=`), not process name, and compare the
      **skip** count against the baseline as well as the failure count — doubled skips
      mean the environment moved.
- [ ] **Pooled thresholds** (§7.9): does any floor, budget or ratchet assert over a
      denominator that can gain new populations (a language, corpus, tenant, region)?
      If so it can fire with no code change. Assert per population above a minimum
      sample size, and record next to the constant which population it was measured on.

- [ ] Is there a written flaky-test policy with quarantine + expiry? No
      policy and visible retry-to-green culture → High.
- [ ] Blanket retries? Grep CI/test config:
      `retries:|retry:|jest.retryTimes|flaky|rerun-fails|--retry` without
      per-test tracking/tickets → High.
- [ ] Quarantine pile: how many tests are quarantined/skipped and how old?
      Grep `skip|xfail|disabled|@Ignore|\.todo|t\.Skip` with `git blame` on a
      sample; skips >90 days with no ticket → Medium each, pattern → High.
- [ ] Coverage gating: hard global threshold (`fail_under|coverageThreshold`
      with a flat number) and evidence of gaming (assertion-light tests on
      trivial code) → Medium; ratchet/diff-coverage instead → good.
- [ ] Is generated/vendored code excluded from coverage? Check coverage
      config excludes vs `*_pb2.py|.pb.go|generated|vendor` → Low.
- [ ] Does the measured scope match the testable core, or does an
      environment-bound shell (UI, device, process-spawn adapters) sit in the
      denominator? Whole-tree measurement with an untestable region →
      Low–Medium (the number is noise; fix the boundary, `sota-architecture`
      rules/02 §14).
- [ ] Are coverage gaps prioritized against complexity (branch-dense +
      thinly-covered first), or is the backlog being worked by whatever moves
      the percentage fastest (trivial modules) → Medium (effort aimed at the
      metric, not the risk).
- [ ] Pipeline timing: PR wall-clock now vs 6 months ago (CI history). >15
      min and growing with no sharding/selection plan → Medium.
- [ ] Slowest tests known? Runner timing reports enabled and reviewed? No
      timing visibility → Low; top test >60s in the unit lane → Medium.
- [ ] Parallel + shuffled in CI? Config shows `-shuffle|--randomize|-p auto|
      --parallel|maxWorkers` in the blocking lane; serial-only suite for
      speed reasons → Medium (isolation debt).
- [ ] Fixed ports/paths blocking parallelism? Grep
      `:8080|:5432|/tmp/test|port = [0-9]{4}` literals in tests → High.
- [ ] Shards balanced by timing? One shard consistently 3× the others in CI
      history → Low–Medium (rebalance).
- [ ] Does main/merge-queue run the full blocking suite? PR-only testing
      with merge-queue skips → High.
- [ ] Red-main discipline: recent history of main staying red >1 day →
      High (process, not code).
- [ ] Nightly jobs owned? Long-running suites whose failures nobody triages
      (check last 10 nightly failures for follow-up) → Medium (dead letter
      queue).
- [ ] **Is every long-run result recorded with the revision it started from?** (§7.7) — and is
      an unexplained ±1 in the test count investigated rather than accepted?
- [ ] **When a ratchet fires, was the flagged site read before the baseline moved?** (§7.8)
      Re-recording destroys the signal and the failure message offers it. Counts quoted in
      prose sit outside every ratchet — derive them in a test whose failure names each place
      that quotes them.
- [ ] **Does a PR that deletes, skips or weakens tests need a human sign-off?** (§7.10)
      Probe a PR's diff:
      `git diff -U0 "$(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)" HEAD | grep -nE '^-[[:space:]]*(async def test_|def test_|func Test|@Test|(it|test)\()|^\+.*(pytest\.mark\.(skip|xfail)|pytest\.skip\(|unittest\.skip|t\.Skip|@Disabled|@Ignore|(it|test|describe)\.skip\(|xit\()'`
      Hits merged with no approval beyond the author's (or an agent's) → High. No
      such check in CI where agents open PRs → Medium.
