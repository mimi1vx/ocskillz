# 02 — Test Design & Quality

What makes one test good. Apply to every test at every layer.

## 2.1 Test behavior, not implementation

The contract: **a pure refactor must not break tests; a behavior change must
break exactly the tests that describe that behavior.** Tests that fail on
refactors train the team to update tests mechanically — at which point the
suite verifies nothing except "the code is what the code is."

- Drive the subject through its public interface (exported function, HTTP
  endpoint, component props/user events) — the same door production uses.
- Assert on observable outcomes: return values, state changes visible through
  the public API, messages emitted across a boundary. Not on private fields,
  call counts of internal helpers, or internal ordering.
- If you need to reach into privates to assert, the design is hiding an
  output. Fix the design (return it, emit it, expose a query) or assert on
  the eventual observable effect.

```ts
// BAD — asserts the mechanism; any internal reshuffle breaks it
it("calls normalize then validate then save", () => {
  const spyN = vi.spyOn(svc as any, "normalize");
  const spyV = vi.spyOn(svc as any, "validate");
  svc.register(input);
  expect(spyN).toHaveBeenCalledBefore(spyV);
});

// GOOD — asserts the outcome; internals are free to change
it("registers a user with a normalized email", async () => {
  await svc.register({ email: "  Ada@Example.COM " });
  expect(await users.findByEmail("ada@example.com")).toBeDefined();
});
```

## 2.2 Arrange–Act–Assert, visibly

Every test has three phases in order, ideally separated by blank lines:
**Arrange** (build the world), **Act** (one call to the subject), **Assert**
(verify the outcome). Given/When/Then is the same discipline.

- **One Act per test.** Multiple act-assert cycles in one test = multiple
  tests trench-coated as one; the first failure hides the rest, and the name
  can't describe what's verified.

```rust
// BAD — phases interleaved; reader must simulate the test to understand it
#[test]
fn cart() {
    let mut c = Cart::new();
    c.add(item("a", 10));
    assert_eq!(c.total(), 10);
    c.add(item("b", 5));
    c.apply_coupon("HALF");
    assert_eq!(c.total(), 8); // 8? from what? half of which subtotal?
}

// GOOD — one behavior, phases visible, expectation derivable by the reader
#[test]
fn coupon_halves_the_cart_total() {
    let cart = a_cart().with_items(&[item("a", 10), item("b", 6)]).build();

    let total = cart.with_coupon("HALF").total();

    assert_eq!(total, 8); // (10 + 6) / 2
}
```
- Arrange noise belongs in builders/helpers (`rules/03`), not inline — but
  the *relevant* arrangement must stay visible in the test (see 2.7 mystery
  guest).
- Assert phase contains no logic. If you're computing the expected value with
  the same algorithm as the SUT, you've tested `x == x` (see 2.7
  tautological tests). Use literals or independently-derived expectations.

## 2.3 One logical assertion per test

One test verifies one *behavior*. That may take several `assert` lines (a
single logical assertion about one outcome object is fine); it may not verify
several *behaviors*.

```go
// FINE — many assert lines, one logical assertion: "parse yields this struct"
cfg, err := Parse(input)
require.NoError(t, err)
assert.Equal(t, "prod", cfg.Env)
assert.Equal(t, 5*time.Second, cfg.Timeout)

// BAD — three behaviors in one test; name lies about at least two of them
func TestUser(t *testing.T) {
    u := New("ada")
    assert.Equal(t, "ada", u.Name)        // creation
    u.Deactivate()
    assert.False(t, u.Active)             // deactivation
    assert.Error(t, u.Charge(10))         // billing rule for inactive users
}
```

Heuristic: if the test name needs "and", split it. Parameterize near-duplicate
behaviors (table tests) instead of cloning test bodies.

## 2.4 Naming is specification

The failing test name alone — in a CI log, without opening the file — must
tell the reader *what behavior broke under what condition*. Pattern:
`subject_scenario_expectation` or a readable sentence.

```
BAD:  test1, testCharge, test_charge_2, it("works"), TestProcess_Error
GOOD: charge_declines_when_card_expired
      Withdraw_returns_InsufficientFunds_when_amount_exceeds_balance
      it("retries idempotent requests at most 3 times on 503")
```

A name you can't write precisely is a sign the test verifies nothing precise.
The suite's names, read top to bottom, should read as the module's spec:

```text
RateLimiter
  ✓ allows requests under the limit
  ✓ rejects the request that exceeds the limit within the window
  ✓ resets the budget when the window elapses
  ✓ tracks limits per API key, not globally
  ✓ fails open when the backing store is unreachable   ← policy made visible
```

That last line is why names matter: a reviewer can challenge "fails open" as
a *decision* without reading any code.

## 2.5 Independence and isolation

Every test must pass: alone, in any order, repeated twice in a row, and in
parallel with its siblings. Violations are High-severity — they manifest as
"passes locally, fails in CI" and block parallelization (`rules/07`).

- **No shared mutable state**: no test mutating module-level/static/global
  variables, no shared fixture object reused across tests by mutation, no
  shared rows in a shared DB without per-test scoping (`rules/04` §4.3).
- **No ordering dependence**: never rely on a previous test having created
  data. Each test arranges its own world; cleanup is the *arranging* test's
  job (better: unique-per-test namespaces/transactions so cleanup is moot).
- **No leakage outward**: tests must not leave env vars, temp files, global
  config, or singletons modified. Use the framework's scoped setup/teardown
  that runs even on failure.
- Smell: a `clearAll()`/`resetDatabase()` at the top of *other* tests means
  someone is leaking. Find the leaker; don't institutionalize the mop.
- Verify mechanically: run the suite shuffled (`pytest -p randomly`,
  `go test -shuffle=on`, jest `--randomize` or sequencer) in CI. Order bugs
  found at introduction time cost minutes; found later, days.

## 2.6 Determinism: inject clock, randomness, and network

A test may consume only inputs it controls. The big three leaks:

- **Time.** Never `now()` in code under test reached by assertions. Inject a
  clock (parameter, constructor, or the language's fake-time facility) and
  pin it. Bugs that only appear at month/DST/leap boundaries become testable;
  "fails every Feb 29 / midnight UTC" flakes become impossible.
- **Randomness.** Inject the RNG or seed it per test. For property-based
  tests, the framework owns the seed and prints it on failure (`rules/06`).
  UUIDs in assertions: inject the generator or assert on shape, not value.
- **Network.** Unit tests touch no sockets. Integration tests touch only
  dependencies the test started itself (`rules/04`). Tests against
  third-party live endpoints belong in a separate, non-blocking suite.
  **Prove this rather than asserting it: block egress and run the suite.**
  Anything that fails was not the unit test it claimed to be. What this catches
  is not a slow test — it is a test that *passes for the wrong reason*, because
  a real call succeeded where the assertion was supposed to do the work. The
  usual mechanism is a config object the code under test never reads: the test
  constructs `Config(providers=[])` while the SUT resolves providers from the
  environment (`sota-code-security` rules/11 §6.7 — a setting counts as applied
  only when you have traced it end-to-end). While you are there, check each
  surviving assertion against the test's own **name**: a test called
  `test_no_providers` asserting `healthy is True` is telling you that one of the
  two is wrong, and the real calls are why nobody noticed.
- **Concurrency.** Never assert on timing ("done within 50ms") as a proxy for
  correctness. Synchronize on events/promises/channels; use the runtime's
  virtual-time tools for timeout logic. `sleep(100ms)` is a flake with a fuse:
  too short on a loaded CI runner, pure waste everywhere else.
- **Iteration order.** Don't assert ordered equality on values harvested from
  unordered structures (hash maps/sets); sort first or compare as sets.

```python
# BAD — breaks at year boundaries, untestable for the interesting cases
def is_expired(card):
    return card.expiry < datetime.now()

# GOOD — clock is an input; boundary cases become one-line tests
def is_expired(card, *, now: datetime) -> bool:
    return card.expiry < now

def test_card_expiring_today_is_not_expired():
    noon = datetime(2026, 6, 12, 12, 0, tzinfo=UTC)
    assert not is_expired(card(expiry=datetime(2026, 6, 12, 23, 59, tzinfo=UTC)), now=noon)
```

## 2.7 Test smells catalog

Name the smell in audit findings; each has a standard fix.

- **Assertion-free test** (Critical): exercises code, asserts nothing — only
  proves "doesn't throw". If no-throw IS the behavior, say so explicitly
  (`assert_does_not_raise`-style) and name it that; otherwise add the real
  assertion. Grep: test bodies with zero `assert|expect|require|should`.
- **Tautological test** (Critical): expected value computed by the same logic
  as the SUT (`assert sut.f(x) == helper_that_reimplements_f(x)`), or
  asserting a mock returns what you stubbed it to return. Verifies nothing.
- **Universally-named test over one item** (High): the name quantifies —
  `test_every_tracked_phase_is_also_reported` — and the loop iterates a
  single-element literal. `sota-code-security` rules/14 §7 falsifies this shape in
  *prose*; here it is worse, because the test **executes and passes**, so it reads
  as the enforcement of the claim its name makes. Third sighting of the shape in one
  codebase (2026-09-05). Read the **loop**, not the name; then either derive the
  collection from the source of truth or rename the test to what it actually covers.
  A green test is not exempt from the quantifier check.
- **Mockery / excessive mocking** (High): more lines configuring doubles than
  asserting outcomes; asserting interactions with internals. Fix via 2.1 and
  `rules/03` boundary discipline.
- **Mystery guest** (Medium): the assertion depends on something outside the
  test the reader can't see — a 400-line shared fixture, a magic row in
  `seed.sql`, file #47 in `testdata/`, or (the original sense of the name in the
  standard catalog) an *external resource* the test reaches for: a file on disk,
  a database, a host. Fix: builders with only the relevant fields explicit
  (`rules/03` §3.5); keep shared fixtures immutable and tiny; replace the
  external resource with a double or move the test to `rules/04`.
- **Resource optimism** (High): the test assumes an external resource is
  *present* — a path, a mount, a reachable endpoint — so its outcome is a
  property of the machine, not of the code. It passes where the resource exists
  and fails, or worse passes vacuously, where it does not. Mystery guest is a
  readability defect; this one is a hermeticity defect, and §2.6's egress block
  is how you find the network half of it.
- **Conditional logic in tests** (Medium→High): `if/else`, `try/except`-and-
  continue, loops with branch-dependent assertions. A test with branches has
  untested branches of itself. Fix: split into one straight-line test per
  case; parameterize.
- **The liar / always-green** (Critical): cannot fail — assertions inside a
  callback that never runs, `expect` inside an `if`, async test missing its
  await so it passes before assertions execute, swallowed assertion
  exceptions. Detect: mutate the SUT, test stays green.
- **Eager test** (Medium): asserts the whole world after one act — 30
  assertions over every field including ones irrelevant to the behavior.
  Brittleness without information. Assert the deltas that define the behavior.
- **Slow-poke at the wrong layer** (Medium): a 5s "unit" test booting a
  framework. Reclassify or rewrite (`rules/01` §1.2).
- **Sleeping test** (High): `sleep`/`waitFor(fixed_ms)` as synchronization.
  Fix: event-based waits, polling-with-timeout helpers, fake time. Grep:
  `sleep\(|Thread\.sleep|time\.Sleep|setTimeout.*done|waitForTimeout`.
- **Hidden retry** (High): `@retry`/`flaky`/rerun annotations on a test
  instead of a root-cause label and quarantine (`rules/07` §7.1).
- **Print-debug residue** (Low): `console.log`/`print` in committed tests.

## 2.8 Snapshot testing discipline

Snapshots (golden files) are legitimate for output whose *exact full form is
the contract*: serialized API responses, generated code/SQL, CLI output,
rendered emails. They are a trap as a default assertion.

- **Small, named, reviewed.** A snapshot a human can't review in a diff is a
  change-detector, not a test. 1000-line component-tree dumps get rubber-
  stamped (`--update` reflex) and then the suite verifies nothing. Prefer
  inline snapshots for anything under ~20 lines so the expectation lives in
  the test.
- **Normalize volatile fields** (timestamps, ids, hostnames, versions) before
  snapshotting, or the snapshot flakes / forces constant updates.
- **One snapshot per behavior**, named for the behavior, never auto-numbered
  (`mismatch-3.snap` tells a reviewer nothing).
- **Updating a snapshot is changing a contract** — the diff must be reviewed
  with exactly that gravity. Bulk `update-snapshots` commits mixing dozens of
  files are a High audit finding.
- For deliberate large goldens (legacy characterization), see approval
  testing in `rules/06` §6.4 — same mechanics, explicit intent.

## 2.9 Comments and structure in tests

- Tests need *why* comments even less than production code — a test whose
  intent isn't obvious from name + body should be rewritten, not annotated.
  The exception: non-obvious magic values (`// 86401 = one day + leap second`)
  and links to the bug a regression test pins (`// regression: #4521`).
- Keep helper indirection shallow: one level of builder/helper. A test you
  can only understand by chasing four helper files has the mystery-guest
  smell with extra steps.

## 2.10 Which method a durable guard is written in

Auditing and authoring are different activities with different lifetimes, and the
library states a default for the first but not the second. An **audit search** is
discarded the day it runs — grep is often the right tool, and `sota-code-security`
rules/10's absence rule already governs it (widen the search, use a second independent
method, state what you ran). A **guard** is a permanent claim that a property holds,
re-evaluated on every commit by people who will not re-derive it. It deserves a stronger
default:

| method | establishes | cannot establish |
|---|---|---|
| text / regex | nothing durable | code vs. a *comment about* code; per-site scope |
| **AST** | structure — call sites, arguments, definitions | dynamic access, types, runtime values |
| **execution / interception** | behaviour — the value actually arrives | only what the test exercises |
| **mutation** | that the guard *can* fail | that the mutation took — assert it |

- **Author structural guards in AST, not text.** Two failure modes are specific to text
  and neither is prevented by care. A guard for `Scanner\s*\(` flagged the file that
  documented *in a comment* that the call had been removed — text cannot tell code from
  prose about code. And a file-scope check ("does this file mention the factory
  anywhere?") lets **one compliant site excuse every other site in the same file**; a
  real regression passed. Inspect the node: for a call, its own keyword arguments.
- **A structural guard cannot carry a behavioural claim.** *"The argument is forwarded"*
  is structure; *"the configured value arrives"* is behaviour, and needs interception or
  execution. Reported case: AST proved a `depth` argument was forwarded and could not
  show whether the forwarded value was the configured `16` or a stale `4`.
- **Mutation-test the guard, then verify the mutation took** (rules/06 §6.3).
- **Regex only where no parser exists** — a DSL, a log format, a config dialect, prose.
  Name which, in a comment, so the exception does not spread by imitation.
- **Name the parser, or the rule gets ignored exactly where it is least convenient.**
  "No parser at hand" is the moment people reach for regex, so decide this at the same
  time as the guard. Take the first rung that carries your claim (tool names verified
  2026-08-20; confirm current entry points at each project's own docs — they move):

  1. **The language's own AST.** Python `ast`, Go `go/ast`, Rust `syn`, Ruby `Prism`,
     JS/TS the `typescript` compiler API or `ts-morph`, Java `JavaParser`, PHP
     `nikic/PHP-Parser`, C# Roslyn syntax trees.
  2. **A semantic index, when the claim needs *types* or cross-file resolution** — which
     is exactly the limit stated below, so this is the rung that answers it rather than
     working around it. **CodeQL** builds a queryable database with names and types
     resolved (v2.26.2 ships extractors for go, python, rust, java, cpp, csharp,
     javascript, ruby, swift — plus yaml, xml, html and GitHub Actions, so config is not
     an exception either). **SCIP/LSIF** indexes, or the language server itself, give
     resolved cross-references without writing queries.
  3. **A cross-language structural matcher, when no native parser is at hand.**
     **Opengrep** matches on a parsed representation rather than text, covers 30+
     languages, and has a **Generic** mode for inputs with no dedicated parser (ERB,
     Jinja and similar). It is LGPL-2.1 and consortium-governed (Aikido, Amplify, Endor
     Labs, Kodem, Orca), forked from Semgrep CE when features moved behind a commercial
     licence — prefer it over the upstream for anything you need to keep running.
     **ast-grep** and **tree-sitter** are the other route: real concrete syntax trees,
     25+ official grammars and bindings for a dozen host languages.
  4. **The toolchain's own analysis API, when the guard should run inside the existing
     build** rather than as a separate job — `go/analysis` (Go), Roslyn analyzers (C#),
     clang-tidy AST matchers (C/C++), ESLint rules over ESTree (JS/TS), RuboCop cops
     (Ruby), PHPStan/Psalm rules (PHP), detekt (Kotlin). Slower to write, but it runs
     where developers already look and fails in the same place as a compile error.
  5. **The artifact or the runtime, when the claim is about what *ships* or what is
     *live*** — and here source analysis is not merely weaker, it answers a different
     question. Reflection over the loaded class, the deprecation annotation on the method
     you actually call, the contents of the built wheel or image, `nm`/`objdump` on the
     binary. A measured case: a JDK's `@Deprecated(since="18")` read off `Runtime.class`
     by reflection settled in seconds what the published docs would not confirm.
  6. **Regex — only where the input genuinely has no grammar**: prose, an ad-hoc log
     format, a bespoke DSL. Note *which*, in a comment, so the exception does not spread
     by imitation.

  Two things this list exists to prevent. **Shell and config are not exceptions**: shell
  has a real AST (`mvdan.cc/sh/v3/syntax` parses POSIX sh, bash and mksh and ships a
  `Walk`), and YAML, HCL, JSON, Dockerfiles and SQL all have parsers — "it's just a
  config file" is how a text guard gets in. And **rung 5 can be cheaper than rung 1**:
  where a claim is about the built or running system, do not parse source at all.

**The honest limit, which the guidance must state or it manufactures the false
confidence the rest of this library exists to prevent: AST does not resolve types.** A
field audit still counts `.timeout_sec` on *any* object, so a name collision with an
unrelated attribute reads as live — a **false negative**, the more dangerous direction.
AST removes string-and-comment noise; it does not remove name ambiguity. The output of a
structural sweep is a **candidate list to verify**, never a verdict, and "AST-based" is
exactly the phrase that tempts a reader to treat it as one.

Measured on one 38k-test Python codebase: the same audit rewritten from `grep` to
`ast.walk` went from **74 orphan candidates to 61**. The thirteen were fields read via
`getattr(cfg, "name")` with a string literal — which the AST pass sees and grep does not.
More precise *and* more sensitive, not a trade.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Durable guards written in **AST** where the claim is structural, not regex over
      source? Two tells that a text guard is in place: it can match a *comment about*
      the code, and it checks file scope rather than the offending node, so one
      compliant site excuses the rest of the file (§2.10).
- [ ] Any structural guard carrying a **behavioural** claim ("the configured value
      arrives") that only execution or interception can support (§2.10)?
- [ ] Does any structural sweep get reported as a **verdict** rather than a candidate
      list? AST does not resolve types, so a name collision reads as live — a false
      negative (§2.10).
- [ ] Any test whose **name quantifies universally** (`every`, `all`, `no_`) looping a
      one- or two-element literal → High (§2.7): it passes, so it reads as enforcement.
- [ ] Assertion-free tests? Mechanical sweep: list test functions lacking any
      assert/expect/require/verify token → Critical each.
- [ ] Can flagship tests fail? Invert one assertion or `return` early in the
      SUT for 2–3 core tests; still green → Critical (the liar).
- [ ] Async tests missing await on the asserted action?
      Grep: `it\(.*async` bodies with un-awaited promises; Python `async def test` without awaited call → Critical.
- [ ] Refactor-brittleness: do tests spy on internal/private methods?
      Grep: `spyOn\(.*(as any)|verify\(.*internal|assert_called.*_private|reflect` in tests → High.
- [ ] Real time in tests/SUT under test? Grep:
      `datetime\.now|time\.Now\(\)|Date\.now|new Date\(\)|System\.currentTimeMillis|Instant\.now` in test paths and in modules with boundary-condition tests → High.
- [ ] **Unit suite run with egress blocked** — any new failure is a test that
      was passing because a real call succeeded → High each; then re-read those
      tests' names against their assertions, and check whether the config they
      construct is the config the SUT actually reads (§2.6).
- [ ] Sleeps as sync? Grep: `time\.sleep|time\.Sleep|Thread\.sleep|setTimeout|waitForTimeout|page\.wait_for_timeout` in tests → High each.
- [ ] Order/parallel safety: does CI run the suite shuffled and parallel?
      Run shuffled once during audit; any new failure → High.
- [ ] Shared mutable state? Grep tests for writes to globals/statics/env:
      `os\.environ\[|process\.env\.[A-Z_]+ *=|static .* =|var [A-Z]` (lang-adjust) without scoped teardown → High.
- [ ] Conditional logic in tests? Grep: `^\s+(if|for|while|try)\b` inside test
      bodies (exclude table-test loops over cases) → Medium.
- [ ] Names as spec: sample 20 names; can you state the behavior from the name
      alone? `test\d|_works|_ok\b|misc|stuff` patterns → Low–Medium.
- [ ] Snapshots: any snapshot file >100 lines, auto-numbered, or updated in
      bulk commits (`git log --oneline -- '**/__snapshots__/**' | head`)?
      Unreviewable snapshots → Medium; routine bulk updates → High.
- [ ] Hidden retries: grep `@pytest.mark.flaky|retries:|jest.retryTimes|@Retry|FlakyTest` → High unless tied to a tracked quarantine (`rules/07`).
