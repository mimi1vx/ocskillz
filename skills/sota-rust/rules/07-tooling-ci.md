# 07 — Tooling, CI & Crate Hygiene

A SOTA Rust repo is recognizable from its CI config alone: lints are deny,
tests run under nextest, MSRV is tested not guessed, features are additive,
and docs build clean. This file defines that baseline.

## 1. Clippy — policy, not vibes

Configure lints **in Cargo.toml** (`[lints]`, inherited workspace-wide), not
scattered `#![allow]`s:

```toml
# workspace Cargo.toml
[workspace.lints.rust]
unsafe_code = "warn"               # forbid in crates that can (rules/03)
missing_docs = "warn"              # libraries: consider deny
unused_must_use = "deny"

[workspace.lints.clippy]
all = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
pedantic = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
# triaged pedantic opt-outs — each with a reason, reviewed yearly:
module_name_repetitions = "allow"  # naming convention conflicts
must_use_candidate = "allow"       # too noisy for app crates
# hard floors:
unwrap_used = "deny"               # production crates (rules/02)
dbg_macro = "deny"
todo = "deny"
undocumented_unsafe_blocks = "deny"
await_holding_lock = "deny"
# nursery opt-ins (the group is not enabled above):
redundant_clone = "warn"           # rules/01, rules/06

# member crates: [lints] workspace = true
```

- **Pedantic triage**, not pedantic-blanket: enable the group, then `allow`
  specific lints with a comment — this catches new pedantic lints on toolchain
  updates instead of opting out of the future.
- **Deny-warnings in CI only**: `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --
  -D warnings` in CI; locally keep warn so WIP compiles. For build warnings,
  Cargo's `build.warnings = "allow"/"warn"/"deny"` config (stable since Rust
  1.97) is the first-class knob — set `CARGO_BUILD_WARNINGS=deny` in the CI
  environment, not in committed config, so local builds stay on warn.
  Hardcoding `#![deny(warnings)]` in source breaks builds on every new rustc
  lint — don't.
- Per-site `#[allow(clippy::xyz, reason = "...")]` (lint reasons are stable)
  over module-level allows; an allow without a reason is a finding.
- Run clippy on the same pinned toolchain as the build (lint sets drift across
  versions).

### 1a. On a constrained target, a style lint's *premise* may be false

Clippy's advice is near-universally correct because it is written against the
assumptions of a hosted target: an 8 MB stack, an allocator, a real `std`. In an
**eBPF program, an embedded or `no_std` crate, a WASM module, a kernel module or an
interrupt handler**, one of those assumptions is gone, and a lint that encodes it
silently spends a resource the compiler will not warn you about.

Worked case. `clippy::needless_borrows_for_generic_args` (style, warn-by-default —
*"taking a reference that is going to be automatically dereferenced"*, verified in
clippy 0.1.97) fired on a map `insert(&key, &now, 0)` inside a BPF program and
suggested the owned form. `insert` takes `impl Borrow<K>`, so the owned call
monomorphises to `Borrow<K> for K` and copies the 52-byte key onto the stack. A BPF
program gets **512 bytes for the whole call chain** — `MAX_BPF_STACK` in the kernel's
`include/linux/filter.h` — of which a helper already held 344. The program stopped
loading:

```text
combined stack size of 2 calls is 544. Too large
```

(that string is emitted by the kernel verifier, `kernel/bpf/verifier.c`.)

Rules:

- **Before taking a lint suggestion in such a crate, name the resource it spends.**
  `Copy` means "cheap to copy" *on an 8 MB stack*; it says nothing about a 512-byte
  one. The same applies to lints that suggest an owned value, an iterator adaptor, a
  `format!`, or anything that inlines a larger frame.
- **Do not let the word "mechanical" stand in for the analysis.** *"Mechanical",
  "trivial", "just a rename", "style only"* are classifications that license skipping
  evaluation, and they are applied **before** the evaluation that would justify them.
  Treat them as a prompt to check, not as a conclusion — this is the linguistic tell
  that a decision was made without being made.
- **Prefer removing the lint's premise over silencing it.** Dropping `Copy` from an
  oversized key type stops the lint firing *and* stops the next contributor
  reintroducing the copy — better than `#[allow]`, which only silences this site. But
  do not then claim the type *enforces* what it merely discourages.
- **Set the policy at the crate, not the call site.** A constrained crate's
  `[lints.clippy]` should `allow` the specific hosted-assumption lints with a reason
  naming the constraint, so the rest of the group keeps working.
- **Only a gate that loads or runs the artifact can catch this** — `fmt`, `clippy`
  and lint passes all stop at the compiled object and were green on the broken one.
  CI and supply-chain controls

### 1b. Source shape is not a proxy for compiled behaviour

§1a is a *lint's* premise being false on a constrained target. This is **your own reasoning's**
premise being false, and it is the harder one because nothing fires.

Rust makes source structure feel like it maps onto machine behaviour — ownership, scopes and
struct layout usually do. At `opt-level=3` with LTO they need not, and on a target where the
limit is checked at **load** time there is no compile error to correct you.

Measured on rustc 1.97.1: a plain helper called once from a function disappears entirely at
`opt-level=3` — the symbol is absent from the emitted assembly, while an `#[inline(never)]`
neighbour in the same file still shows three call sites (the control that proves the absence
is real, not a search artefact).

```console
$ rustc -C opt-level=0 --emit asm t.rs && grep -c fill t.s   # 2  — the boundary exists
$ rustc -C opt-level=3 --emit asm t.rs && grep -c fill t.s   # 0  — it does not
```

Field-reported consequence: a helper was extracted from an eBPF program specifically so each
transport would own one large stack local instead of two, and that reasoning was written into
a commit message as fact. The verifier's own numbers before and after were **identical** —
`stack depth 136+0+344+0` both times. The refactor was sound; the justification was fiction.

- **A claim about memory layout cites a measurement from the toolchain that enforces the
  limit** — the verifier's report, `-Zprint-type-sizes`, a linker map, `--emit asm`. Write it
  as *"measured X on Y"* or do not write it.
- **Extracting a function does not create a scope the optimiser must honour.** If you need
  two lifetimes not to overlap, you need something the compiler cannot inline through — a
  separate program, an explicit `#[inline(never)]`, or a different data flow.
- **The numbers to compare are before and after on the same toolchain**, not one reading and
  an argument. `sota-code-security` rules/15 §2a: a *pass* is not a number.

## 2. rustfmt — zero-config by default

- `cargo fmt --check` in CI. Default style; a `rustfmt.toml` should contain
  only deliberate deviations (e.g. `imports_granularity = "Crate"`,
  `group_imports = "StdExternalCrate"` — nightly-only options mean fmt runs
  on nightly toolchain in CI if used).
- Never hand-format against rustfmt; never argue style in review — that's the
  tool's job.

## 3. Tests & cargo-nextest

- `cargo nextest run` over `cargo test`: process-per-test isolation (one
  test's panic/env pollution can't poison others), better parallelism, flaky
  retries with detection (`--retries N` + reporting), per-test timeouts
  (`slow-timeout` + `terminate-after` — hangs fail instead of stalling CI),
  JUnit output. Note: nextest doesn't run doctests — keep a separate
  `cargo test --doc` step.
- Test taxonomy: unit tests in-module (`#[cfg(test)]`), integration tests in
  `tests/` (compile as separate crates — each file is a binary; group to keep
  link time sane), doctests on every public API example (they're the only
  examples guaranteed to compile).
- Property tests (`proptest`) for parsers/serializers/invariant-heavy code;
  snapshot tests (`insta`) for rendered output; `loom` for atomics (rules/03);
  fuzz for untrusted-input parsers (rules/05).
- Coverage: `cargo llvm-cov nextest` — track trend, don't worship the number.

## 4. MSRV policy

- Declare it: `rust-version = "1.85"` in `[package]`/`[workspace.package]` —
  cargo refuses to build on older toolchains with a clear error instead of
  cryptic syntax failures.
- **Test it**: a CI job building with the pinned MSRV toolchain
  (`cargo check --all-features` after CI provisions that compiler); `cargo msrv
  verify` / `cargo msrv find`
  to maintain. An untested MSRV claim is false within two dependency bumps —
  note deps' MSRV bumps in *minor* versions can break you; this is what the
  MSRV-aware resolver (Rust 1.84+, `resolver.incompatible-rust-versions =
  "fallback"`) mitigates.
- Policy in README/CONTRIBUTING: which versions you support and whether an
  MSRV bump is a semver-minor (common convention) — pick one and say it.
- Applications: pin the toolchain exactly with `rust-toolchain.toml`
  (reproducible builds, same clippy everywhere). Libraries: MSRV floor +
  repository-supported stable CI matrix. For local work, use the installed
  system version when it satisfies those constraints.

### 4a. The build is more than `Cargo.toml` — flags, profiles, channel, target

The profile a reviewer reads in `Cargo.toml` is not the whole build. Measured on cargo
1.97.1 unless a doc is cited:

- **Flags from outside the manifest override the profile.** Cargo passes
  `-C overflow-checks=on` from `[profile.release] overflow-checks = true` and then
  *appends* `RUSTFLAGS`, so `RUSTFLAGS='-C overflow-checks=off'` won: an overflow test that
  failed without it passed with it. `CARGO_BUILD_RUSTFLAGS`, `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` and
  `[build] rustflags` in a `.cargo/config.toml` did the same — including a config file in a
  **parent directory** of the crate. Cargo reads `.cargo/config.toml` from the working
  directory and every ancestor, then `$CARGO_HOME` (cargo reference, "Hierarchical
  structure"). Nothing in the repository changed.
- **`rustc-wrapper` runs a program on every compile.** A `[build] rustc-wrapper` in any of
  those files ran on `cargo check` (not on `cargo metadata`). That is build-time code
  execution with `build.rs`'s trust (rules/05 §2), except it can come from outside the
  repository. A legitimate wrapper (e.g. a compiler cache) is named, pinned and documented.
- **Dev and test profiles keep their checks.** `overflow-checks` and `debug-assertions` are
  on by default in `dev`/`test`. Turning them off there — in `Cargo.toml` or in a config
  file's `[profile.*]` — made an overflow test and a `debug_assert!` test pass that had
  failed. The suite then stops catching the wrapping arithmetic that release ships silently
  (rules/05 §3). (ANSSI DENV-CARGO-OPTS, DENV-CARGO-ENVVARS)
- **Ship from stable.** `#![feature(..)]` fails on stable (E0554) until `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1`
  is set; with it, the same crate built on the stable toolchain. Treat `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP`
  anywhere in a release build as a nightly build. Nightly jobs for Miri, sanitizers and
  fuzzing (rules/03 §4) are tooling; they do not build what ships. (DENV-STABLE)
- **A deploy target is a tier decision.** Per the rustc platform-support page, tier 1 is
  "guaranteed to work" (built and tested on every change), tier 2 "guaranteed to build"
  (tests not always run), and tier 3 has no official builds. Tiers move:
  `x86_64-apple-darwin` was tier 1 at 1.85 and later dropped to tier 2, so re-check at each
  toolchain bump. Safety-critical software uses tier-1 targets and a qualified toolchain.
  (DENV-TIERS)

## 5. Feature flag hygiene

Features must be **additive**: enabling a feature may only add API/behavior,
never remove or change it. Cargo unifies features across the graph — if crate
A needs `foo` without feature X and crate B enables X, A gets X too; mutually
exclusive features break the ecosystem.

```toml
[features]
default = ["std"]
std = []
serde = ["dep:serde", "uuid?/serde"]   # dep: = no implicit feature for optional deps
                                        # ?/ = enable serde on uuid only if uuid is on
full = ["serde", "metrics"]            # convenience aggregate, still additive
```

- `dep:` syntax for optional dependencies (no accidental public
  `features = ["serde"]` exposure of dep names); `pkg?/feat` for weak
  (conditional) feature forwarding.
- No `no-std`-style **negative features** (`no_std = []` that removes things);
  model it as positive `std` in `default`, with `default-features = false`
  consumers opting in.
- **Test the matrix**: `cargo hack check --feature-powerset --depth 2` (or at
  minimum: `--no-default-features`, default, `--all-features`) in CI — feature
  combinations nobody compiles are broken combinations.
- Don't gate public API breaking-ly (a feature that changes a type's layout or
  a function's signature = non-additive = ecosystem breakage).
- Keep default features lean; heavyweight integrations (TLS stacks, runtimes)
  always optional and documented.
- cfg dispatch: prefer built-in `cfg_select!` (stable since Rust 1.95,
  compile-time match on cfgs) over adding the `cfg-if` dependency in new code.

## 6. Documentation discipline (docs.rs)

- Every public item documented; `#![warn(missing_docs)]` on libraries.
  First line = one-sentence summary (it's the item's listing line); then
  details, then `# Examples` (doctested), `# Errors` (when `Result`),
  `# Panics` (every documented panic path — clippy `missing_panics_doc`),
  `# Safety` (every `unsafe fn` — rules/03).
- Crate root (`lib.rs`) gets the long-form intro: what/why/quickstart —
  `#![doc = include_str!("../README.md")]` keeps README and docs in sync
  (and doctests the README's examples).
- Feature-gated items: build docs.rs with all features and label them:

```toml
[package.metadata.docs.rs]
all-features = true
rustdoc-args = ["--cfg", "docsrs"]
```

```rust
#[cfg_attr(docsrs, doc(cfg(feature = "serde")))]   // renders "Available on feature serde"
```

- Intra-doc links (`[`Vec`]`, `[`crate::Config`]`) over bare URLs — checked at
  build (`rustdoc::broken_intra_doc_links` is deny-worthy).
- CI: `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps --all-features` so doc
  rot fails the build.

## 7. Edition 2024 notes

Current edition as of mid-2026; new code starts here (`edition = "2024"`,
Rust ≥1.85). Use the installed system compiler when it meets this requirement;
do not upgrade merely to obtain the latest stable. The next edition is expected
~2027 on the usual three-year cadence — nothing to migrate toward yet.
Migration: `cargo fix --edition` then review. Key changes that affect rules in
this skill:

- `unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn`: unsafe fns need explicit inner `unsafe {}` blocks
  (rules/03 §2 — good: per-obligation SAFETY comments).
- `static_mut_refs` denied: references to `static mut` rejected — migrate to
  atomics/`OnceLock`/`Mutex` (rules/03 §3).
- **RPIT lifetime capture**: return-position `impl Trait` now captures *all*
  in-scope lifetimes by default (was: only named ones) — use
  `+ use<'a, T>` precise-capture syntax to opt out; check existing APIs whose
  returned opaques suddenly borrow more.
- `unsafe extern` blocks and unsafe attributes (`#[unsafe(no_mangle)]`) —
  FFI declarations are now explicitly trust-me-marked.
- **`if let` scrutinee temporaries** now drop before the `else` block (were:
  end of the whole `if let`) — a `RefCell` borrow or lock guard taken in the
  condition is released before `else` runs. **`match` scrutinee temporaries
  are unchanged**: a guard created in the scrutinee still lives through every
  arm, so `match m.lock().unwrap().get() { … }` holds the lock across the arms.
  Separately, **tail-expression temporaries** of a block now drop before the
  block's locals. Measured on rustc 1.97.1: 2021 printed `else-body` then the
  `if let` temporary's drop, 2024 the reverse; the `match` order was identical.
- **Newly `unsafe` functions**: `std::env::set_var`, `std::env::remove_var`
  and `CommandExt::before_exec` (E0133 without an `unsafe` block on 1.97.1).
  Setting the environment races any thread that reads it, so call these only
  before spawning threads or starting an async runtime (first lines of `main`),
  with a `// SAFETY:` comment saying so; prefer passing an explicit config
  struct over mutating the process environment, and `Command::env` for a child.
- `Future`/`IntoFuture` in prelude; `gen` keyword reserved.
- Resolver v3 (MSRV-aware) default with edition 2024 (§4).

## 8. Semver enforcement & release automation

- **`cargo semver-checks`** in CI for published libraries: diffs the public
  API against the last release and fails on undeclared breaking changes
  (removed items, changed signatures, new non-defaulted trait methods, auto
  trait leaks like a type silently becoming `!Send`). Run on release PRs at
  minimum; it catches the breakage humans reliably miss.
- Semver hazards it can't fully see — review manually: blanket impl
  additions, `#[non_exhaustive]` removal (breaking to *remove*), MSRV bumps
  (declare policy, §4), feature removals/renames (features are public API),
  and doc-promised behavior changes.
- **Release automation**: `release-plz` (or `cargo-release`) — version bump
  from conventional commits, changelog generation, tag, `cargo publish` with
  `--locked` from CI. Authenticate with **crates.io Trusted Publishing**
  (GitHub Actions since July 2025; GitLab CI/CD documented as a **public beta**,
  GitLab.com only — self-hosted instances unsupported — with an `id_tokens:` entry of
  `aud: crates.io` whose JWT the documented helper script POSTs to
  `/api/v1/trusted_publishing/tokens`; crates.io/docs/trusted-publishing and
  blog.rust-lang.org 2026-01-21, checked 2026-09-25). On GitHub
  the job gets `permissions: id-token: write`, runs in a protected GitHub
  `environment` (with required reviewers) and exchanges its OIDC token via
  `rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action` (pinned by SHA) for a short-lived publish
  token — no stored secret. Fill in the trusted-publisher config's optional
  `environment` field: left empty, any environment in that workflow may
  publish. A scoped, expiring registry token
  (`publish-update` on the named crates) is the fallback for other CI.
  Manual `cargo publish` from laptops drifts from the audited lockfile and
  skips the gates. (blog.rust-lang.org, 2025-07-11 crates.io update.)
- Changelog discipline: keep a human-readable CHANGELOG.md (generated or
  curated); "see git log" is not a changelog. Yanked releases
  (`cargo yank`) for published-broken versions — yank doesn't delete, it
  stops *new* resolution.
- Binaries: `cargo dist` (or equivalent) for multi-target release artifacts,
  checksums, and installers from one config; cross-compilation via `cross`
  or toolchain targets exercised in CI *before* the release tag, not during.

## 9. The CI baseline (copy this shape)

```yaml
jobs:
  check:   # fmt + clippy + doc, pinned stable toolchain
    - cargo fmt --check
    - cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
    - RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --all-features
  test:
    - cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features
    - cargo test --doc --workspace
  msrv:
    # Run after CI provisions MSRV as the PATH-resolved system toolchain.
    - cargo check --workspace --all-features
  features:
    - cargo hack check --workspace --feature-powerset --depth 2
  supply-chain:        # rules/05
    - cargo deny check
  unsafe-crates-only:  # rules/03
    # Run with a system-provided nightly containing Miri.
    - cargo miri test -p crate-with-unsafe
```

Plus scheduled: `cargo audit` (new advisories), fuzz jobs, bench regression
gate (rules/06). Cache with `Swatinem/rust-cache`; pin action SHAs (rules/05).

## Audit checklist

- [ ] `[lints]` table present and workspace-inherited; `rg '#!\[allow' -t rust`
      — blanket crate-level allows without reasons = Low each, pattern = Medium.
- [ ] CI runs clippy with `-D warnings` on `--all-targets --all-features`;
      source does NOT hardcode `#![deny(warnings)]`.
- [ ] **Constrained crates (eBPF, `no_std`, embedded, WASM, kernel) — is any lint
      suggestion taken on a false premise?** (§1a) For each accepted style fix in such a
      crate, name the resource it spends (stack frame, allocation, code size); hosted-
      assumption lints are `allow`ed at the crate with a reason naming the constraint.
      A change described as "mechanical" in one of these crates is unreviewed, not safe.
- [ ] **Any claim about stack, size or layout that cites the SOURCE rather than a
      measurement?** (§1b) At `opt-level=3` with LTO a plain helper's boundary does not exist
      in the artefact — measured, a single-call helper vanishes entirely — so "I extracted it
      so the locals would not overlap" is not evidence. Cite the enforcing toolchain's own
      number, before and after.
- [ ] **Does any gate load or run the artifact?** (§1a) `fmt`, `clippy` and lint passes
      all stop at the compiled object; a crate whose failures appear at load or verify
      time is ungated until one gate executes it on the real target.
- [ ] `cargo fmt --check` green and in CI; `rustfmt.toml` deviations are
      deliberate and few.
- [ ] Tests: nextest in CI + separate doctest step; per-test timeout
      configured; `rg '#\[ignore\]' -t rust` — ignored tests have reasons.
- [ ] `rust-version` declared AND exercised by a CI job; binaries have
      `rust-toolchain.toml`. `cargo msrv verify` passes.
- [ ] **Profile overrides** (§4a): `find . \( -name Cargo.toml -o -path '*/.cargo/config' -o -path '*/.cargo/config.toml' \) -type f -not -path '*/target/*' -exec grep -nE '^[[:space:]]*(overflow-checks|debug-assertions)[[:space:]]*=[[:space:]]*false' /dev/null {} +`
      — a hit under `[profile.dev]`/`[profile.test]`, or a profile inheriting them, =
      Medium. `find`, not `grep -r .`: it enters `.cargo/`, which `rg` and `ugrep` skip by
      default (measured for ugrep).
- [ ] **Flag and wrapper overrides** (§4a): `find . \( -path '*/.cargo/config' -o -path '*/.cargo/config.toml' -o -path '*/.github/*' -o -name '.gitlab-ci.yml' -o -name Makefile -o -name justfile -o -name Dockerfile \) -type f -not -path '*/target/*' -exec grep -nE 'rustflags|rustc-wrapper|rustc[[:space:]]*=|RUSTFLAGS|RUSTC_WRAPPER|RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP|CARGO_(BUILD|ENCODED)_RUSTFLAGS' /dev/null {} +`
      — `-C overflow-checks`/`-C debug-assertions` in any hit overrides the profile =
      Medium; an unexplained `rustc-wrapper` = High; `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP` in a release build =
      Medium. Then the ancestors, which no repository search sees — on the build machine:
      `d=$PWD; c=0; n=0; while :; do for f in "$d/.cargo/config" "$d/.cargo/config.toml"; do [ -f "$f" ] || continue; c=$((c+1)); grep -nE 'rustflags|rustc-wrapper|rustc[[:space:]]*=' "$f" /dev/null && n=$((n+1)); done; [ "$d" = / ] && break; d=$(dirname "$d"); done; echo "ancestor configs read: $c, with overrides: $n" >&2; [ "$n" -gt 0 ]`
      — like `grep`, exits 0 on a hit and 1 on none, and prints how many files it read (plus
      `$CARGO_HOME/config.toml` when `CARGO_HOME` is set elsewhere).
- [ ] Channel and target (§4a): `grep -rnE '#!\[feature\(' --include='*.rs' .` in a shipped
      crate = Medium (a nightly-only build); the release build's toolchain is stable; each
      deploy target triple is tier 1, or tier 2 by a recorded decision.
- [ ] Features: `rg 'no[-_](std|default)' Cargo.toml` style negative features
      = Medium (non-additive); optional deps using `dep:`; feature matrix job
      (`cargo hack`) present; `--no-default-features` builds.
- [ ] Docs: `missing_docs` on lib crates; `# Errors`/`# Panics`/`# Safety`
      sections present (`clippy::missing_errors_doc`, `missing_panics_doc`,
      `missing_safety_doc`); docs.rs metadata for feature-gated crates;
      doc job with `-D warnings`.
- [ ] Edition: new crates on 2024; pre-2024 crates have a migration note or
      reason; post-migration, re-audit `static mut` and RPIT capture changes,
      locks/borrows in `if let` vs `match` scrutinees, and every
      `unsafe { env::set_var | remove_var }` — `rg 'set_var|remove_var' -t rust`
      (each must run before any thread or runtime starts, with a SAFETY comment).
- [ ] Published libraries: `cargo semver-checks` in release CI; publishing
      automated (`release-plz`/`cargo-release`) with `--locked`, not from
      laptops; publish job uses Trusted Publishing (`id-token: write`,
      `crates-io-auth-action`, environment-gated) or else a scoped token —
      `rg 'CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN' .github/` with no `crates-io-auth-action`
      beside it = Low; on GitLab.com,
      `rg -q 'aud:[[:space:]]*crates\.io' .gitlab-ci.yml || rg -n 'CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN' .gitlab-ci.yml`
      printing anything (a stored token, no crates.io id-token) = Low; CHANGELOG maintained.
- [ ] Reproducibility: `Cargo.lock` committed, toolchain pinned, CI action
      SHAs pinned, `rust-cache` keyed correctly (not caching stale clippy).
- [ ] Quick greps: `rg 'dbg!|println!' -t rust -g '!*test*' -g '!*/bin/*'`
      (debug leftovers in libs); `rg 'FIXME|HACK|XXX' -t rust` triaged.
