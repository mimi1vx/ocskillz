# 03 — Idioms, Pitfalls, Exceptions & Logging

The bugs Python invites, and the idioms that prevent them. Most items here are mechanical to
audit (grep/ruff patterns at the end) and mechanical to fix.

## 1. Mutable default arguments (B006)

Defaults are evaluated **once at definition**. Every call shares the same object.

```python
# Bad — every caller without `tags` shares one list
def create(name: str, tags: list[str] = []) -> Item: ...

# Good
def create(name: str, tags: list[str] | None = None) -> Item:
    tags = [] if tags is None else tags
```

Also applies to `{}`, `set()`, `datetime.now()` (frozen at import time!), and any class
instance default. `dataclass` fields: use `field(default_factory=list)` — Python raises for
bare mutable defaults in dataclasses but not for arbitrary mutable objects.

## 2. Late-binding closures (B023)

Loop variables are looked up when the closure **runs**, not when it's created:

```python
# Bad — all callbacks see the final value of `name`
callbacks = [lambda: greet(name) for name in names]

# Good — bind at definition time
callbacks = [lambda name=name: greet(name) for name in names]
# Better — functools.partial states intent
callbacks = [partial(greet, name) for name in names]
```

Hits hardest with callbacks registered in loops (Qt signals, asyncio callbacks, pytest
parametrization done by hand).

## 3. Comprehensions vs loops

- Comprehension when it fits on 1–2 lines and produces a collection. Loop when there are side
  effects, multiple accumulators, or nested conditionals — a 4-line comprehension with three
  `if`s is worse than a loop.
- **Generator expressions** when the consumer is an aggregator or you iterate once:
  `sum(x.price for x in items)` — no intermediate list.
- Never a comprehension for side effects: `[db.save(x) for x in items]` allocates a list of
  `None`s and hides intent. Use a `for` loop.
- `dict`/`set` comprehensions over `dict(zip(...))` gymnastics. Know
  `{k: f(v) for k, v in d.items()}`.

## 4. Context managers for every resource

Anything with acquire/release semantics goes through `with`: files, locks, connections,
transactions, subprocesses, tempfiles, sockets.

```python
# Bad — leaks on exception, ResourceWarning under -X dev
f = open(path); data = f.read(); f.close()

# Good
with open(path) as f:
    data = f.read()

# Own resources: contextmanager for simple cases
@contextmanager
def acquired(lock: Lock) -> Iterator[None]:
    lock.acquire()
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        lock.release()

# Dynamic numbers of resources
with ExitStack() as stack:
    files = [stack.enter_context(open(p)) for p in paths]
```

Run tests with `python -X dev` occasionally — `ResourceWarning` surfaces unclosed handles.

## 5. pathlib over os.path / string surgery

```python
# Bad
out = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..", "data", name + ".json")

# Good
out = (Path(__file__).parent.parent / "data" / f"{name}.json").resolve()
data = out.read_text(encoding="utf-8")
```

`Path.read_text/write_text/read_bytes`, `.glob`, `.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`,
`.with_suffix`, `.relative_to`. Always pass `encoding="utf-8"` to text I/O while your floor is
below 3.15 — before that the default is the locale encoding (cp1252 on many Windows hosts), so
the same file reads differently per machine. UTF-8 mode is on by default from 3.15 (PEP 686;
`sys.flags.utf8_mode` read 1 on 3.15.0b4 and 0 on 3.14.6, measured 2026-09-25), and an
explicit `encoding=` stays correct on every version. Security note: `Path` does NOT prevent
traversal; see rules/05 §4.

## 6. EAFP vs LBYL

Default to EAFP — ask forgiveness — because LBYL check-then-act races:

```python
# Bad — TOCTOU: file can vanish between check and open
if os.path.exists(path):
    with open(path) as f: ...

# Good
try:
    with open(path) as f: ...
except FileNotFoundError:
    handle_missing()
```

Same for `dict` access (`try/KeyError` or `.get` with a real default, not `if k in d` then
`d[k]` twice), and for any filesystem/network/shared-state precondition. LBYL is fine for pure
in-memory validation of caller arguments where no race exists and the check reads better.

## 7. Dataclass patterns

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class Money:
    amount: Decimal
    currency: str

    def __post_init__(self) -> None:
        if self.amount.as_tuple().exponent < -2:
            raise ValueError("sub-cent amount")
```

- `frozen=True` by default: hashable, safe as dict keys, no aliasing surprises.
- `slots=True`: ~40–60% memory reduction, faster attribute access, typo'd attributes raise.
  Skip only when you need `__dict__` (dynamic attrs, some mixin patterns, `cached_property`
  needs `__dict__` — use `slots=True` + a manual cache or drop slots there).
- `kw_only=True` for >3 fields or any boolean field — positional booleans are unreadable.
- `field(default_factory=...)` for mutable defaults; `field(repr=False)` for secrets so they
  don't hit logs.

## 8. Enums

```python
class Status(StrEnum):          # 3.11+: members ARE str — JSON/DB-friendly
    OPEN = "open"
    CLOSED = "closed"
```

- `StrEnum`/`IntEnum` when values serialize; plain `Enum` + `auto()` when values are opaque.
- Compare by identity (`status is Status.OPEN`); never compare enum to raw string except at
  parse boundaries (`Status(raw)` — which also validates and raises `ValueError`).
- `Flag` for bitmask sets instead of int constants.
- Magic strings appearing ≥3 times with branching logic → that's an enum.

## 9. itertools / functools — use the stdlib, don't reimplement

Know cold: `itertools.chain`, `batched` (3.12), `pairwise`, `groupby` (input must be sorted by
the same key — classic bug), `islice`, `product`, `takewhile`;
`functools.cache`/`lru_cache` (caveats in rules/06), `cached_property`, `partial`, `reduce`
(sparingly), `singledispatch` for type-based dispatch without isinstance ladders;
`collections.Counter`, `defaultdict`, `deque` (O(1) popleft — never `list.pop(0)` in a loop).
Hand-rolled chunking/flattening/windowing functions in a utils.py are an audit smell: replace
with itertools and delete.

## 10. Exception design

**Catch narrowly, raise precisely, never silence.**

```python
# Bad — swallows KeyboardInterrupt/SystemExit, hides every bug
try:
    process(item)
except:               # bare
    pass

# Bad — Exception + pass is barely better
except Exception:
    pass

# Good
try:
    process(item)
except (ValidationError, IOError) as e:
    logger.warning("skipping %s: %s", item.id, e)
```

Rules:
- **Never bare `except:`** (E722). `except Exception` is the widest acceptable catch and only
  at top-level boundaries (request handler, worker loop, CLI main) — and it must log with
  traceback (`logger.exception(...)`) and usually re-raise or convert.
- Define a small exception hierarchy per package: `class AppError(Exception)` root, callers
  catch your types, not `Exception`.
- **Chain on translation:** `raise StorageError("save failed") from e` — preserves the cause;
  `from None` only when deliberately hiding (rare). Bare re-wrap without `from` loses the
  trail (ruff B904).
- **No exceptions as cross-layer control flow.** Inside one function/module, `StopIteration`-
  style signaling is idiomatic; raising `NotFoundError` from the DB layer and catching it in
  the HTTP layer is fine *if it's a declared domain exception*. What's banned: using generic
  exceptions to implement branching across layers ("raise ValueError to mean retry"), and
  try/except spanning 50 lines where you can't tell which statement is expected to fail —
  keep `try` bodies minimal.
- `else:` clause on try when code should run only if no exception — keeps the `try` body tight.
- **Exception groups (3.11+):** `TaskGroup` and concurrent code raise `ExceptionGroup`; handle
  with `except*`:
  ```python
  try:
      async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg: ...
  except* httpx.HTTPError as eg:
      for e in eg.exceptions: logger.error("fetch failed: %s", e)
  ```
  Code that catches `Exception` around a TaskGroup and inspects nothing loses errors.

## 11. Logging done right

```python
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)        # module level, never the root logger

# Bad — f-string formats even when DEBUG is off; breaks aggregation grouping
logger.debug(f"user {user_id} fetched {n} rows")

# Good — lazy %-formatting; args interpolated only if the record is emitted
logger.debug("user %s fetched %d rows", user_id, n)

# Errors with traceback
except StorageError:
    logger.exception("save failed for order %s", order_id)   # includes stack automatically
```

- **No f-strings/`.format()`/`+` in log calls** (ruff `G` rules): wasted CPU at high-volume
  call sites, and every message becomes unique — log aggregators can't group them, and
  user-controlled values get interpolated even when not logged (injection surface).
- Libraries: never call `basicConfig()`, never add handlers — configure logging only in the
  application entry point (`logging.config.dictConfig`). A library that configures logging
  hijacks the host app.
- Structured logging for services: `structlog` or stdlib + JSON formatter; bind context
  (request id, user id) once, not per call. Put variable data in fields, not in the message.
- `logger.exception` only inside `except` blocks; `logger.error(..., exc_info=True)` is the
  equivalent elsewhere.
- Never log secrets/tokens/PII — pair with `field(repr=False)` and dedicated redaction.
- No `print()` in library/server code (ruff T20). CLIs print to stdout for *output*, log to
  stderr for *diagnostics*.

## 12. Small-but-deadly grab bag

- `is`/`is not` only for `None`, `True`, `False`, sentinels, enums — never for strings/ints
  (interning makes it *sometimes* work, which is worse).
- Returning `-1`/`0`/`""` to mean "absent" instead of `None`: type-checks, survives a
  truthiness check, and flips ordering comparisons. Producer shape and the three
  detectors in rules/02 §2a.
- Naive datetimes: always `datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc)`; `utcnow()` is deprecated and naive
  (ruff DTZ).
- `zip(a, b, strict=True)` (3.10+) when silent truncation would hide a length-mismatch bug.
- Shadowing builtins (`list`, `id`, `type`, `input`) — rename (ruff A).
- String building in loops: collect + `"".join(parts)` (perf details rules/06).
- `round()` is banker's rounding; money math uses `Decimal` with explicit quantize.
- **Non-finite numbers from input.** `float()` accepts `"nan"`, `"inf"`, `"Infinity"` in any
  case and with surrounding whitespace; `Decimal("NaN")`/`Decimal("Infinity")` parse too, and
  `json.loads` accepts bare `NaN`/`Infinity`/`-Infinity` by default. Every float comparison
  with NaN is `False`, so `if x < lo or x > hi: raise` lets NaN through (measured, 3.14).
  After parsing, reject with `math.isfinite(x)` / `d.is_finite()`; pass `json.loads(...,
  parse_constant=<raising fn>)` and `json.dumps(..., allow_nan=False)`.
- **Division and the extremes.** `/`, `//`, `%` by zero raise `ZeroDivisionError` for int
  *and* float; `Decimal` raises `DivisionByZero`/`InvalidOperation` under the default traps
  — guard the divisor so the error is a 4xx, not a 500. `int` never overflows (`MIN // -1`
  and `-MIN` are exact), so the risks move: `int(float("inf"))` raises `OverflowError`,
  `1e308 * 10` silently becomes `inf`, `timedelta(seconds=huge)` raises, and a float-built
  unit conversion (`int(secs * 1e9)`) loses precision — do it in `int` or `Decimal`.
  Fixed-width values reappear at C boundaries: numpy `int64` arrays wrap silently on
  add/negate (even under `np.errstate(over="raise")`, which only traps scalars), and
  `struct.pack("<q", ...)`/DB `BIGINT` reject out-of-range — range-check before them.
  (OWASP: Go-SCP general coding practices; SCSVS arithmetic.)
- Don't mutate a list/dict while iterating it — iterate a copy or build a new one.

## 13. Public API surface — what you are promising

Everything above is about code that works. This is about code other people import, where the
cost of a change is paid by someone who cannot see your reasoning. The shared design rules
live in `sota-architecture`; what follows is the Python-specific mechanism.

**`__all__` controls exactly one thing, and it is not privacy.** It is the name list for
`from mod import *`, and it is what documentation tooling reads as the public surface. It
does **not** stop anyone importing `mod._helper`, and it does not affect `dir()`. Define it
in every module that is part of a package's public API; a module without it has no stated
surface, so every name in it is arguably public — including your imports, which is the usual
accident (`from .internal import Session` re-exports `Session` from your module).

**A leading underscore is a convention with one enforced exception.** `_name` promises
nothing to the interpreter — it is a signal to readers and a default filter in tooling. Only
`__name` inside a class body is mechanically different, and that is name mangling to
`_Class__name`, which exists to avoid subclass collisions and not to prevent access. Do not
describe either as private in a docstring; describe the support promise instead.

```python
# GOOD — the surface is stated, and re-exported names are deliberate
__all__ = ["Client", "ClientError"]

from ._transport import Session     # NOT in __all__, but still importable as mod.Session
```

**Keyword-only parameters are an API decision, not a style one.** A positional parameter is a
promise about *order* that you can never change; a keyword-only one is a promise about a
*name*. Put `*` before anything optional, anything boolean, and anything you might reorder —
which in practice is most options.

```python
# BAD  — retry and timeout are now positionally frozen forever
def fetch(url, timeout, retry): ...

# GOOD — order is free to change; call sites read at the point of use
def fetch(url, *, timeout: float = 5.0, retry: int = 3): ...
```

A boolean positional argument is the special case worth calling out: `render(doc, True)` is
unreadable at the call site and unchangeable at the definition.

**`__slots__` is a public commitment, and the direction matters.** It removes the per-instance
`__dict__`, so consumers can no longer set arbitrary attributes on your objects. **Adding it
to a released class is a breaking change; removing it is not.** Subclasses need their own
`__slots__` or they regain a `__dict__` and the saving is gone, and `__weakref__` must be
listed explicitly if anything takes weak references. Use it for high-cardinality value
objects, not for everything.

**Deprecate with a decorator, not a docstring.** `warnings.deprecated` (**Python 3.13+**,
PEP 702 — Final) warns at runtime *and* makes type checkers flag call sites, which is the half
a docstring cannot do. Below 3.13 the same decorator is in `typing_extensions`. Emit
`DeprecationWarning` and keep the old name working for at least one minor release; a
deprecation that removes in the same release is a break with extra steps.

```python
from warnings import deprecated          # 3.13+; typing_extensions.deprecated before that

@deprecated("Use Client.fetch() instead; removed in 3.0")
def get(url: str) -> Response: ...
```

**`DeprecationWarning` is hidden by default** outside `__main__`, so the warning your users
need is the one they will not see. Make your own test suite fail on it
(`filterwarnings = ["error::DeprecationWarning"]` in pytest config) or you will ship past your
own deprecations without noticing.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] **Ruff covers most of this file — run first** —
      `uvx ruff check --select B006,B008,B023,B904,E722,BLE,G,T20,DTZ,PTH,SIM,A,C4 --statistics .`

      (a class field typed plain `str`: a dataclass `repr` prints it — measured,
      `Creds(user='bob', password='hunter2')` — so use `field(repr=False)` or `SecretStr`)
- [ ] **Resource handling** — `grep -rn "= open(" --include="*.py" src/ | grep -v "with "`

      `find src -name '*.py' -not -name '__init__.py' -not -path '*/tests/*' -print0 |` ;
      `while IFS= read -r -d '' f; do` ; `grep -q '__all__' "$f" || echo "no __all__: $f"` ;
      `done`
- [ ] **Boolean/optional parameters frozen positionally — no `*` in the signature [MEDIUM]** —
      `grep -rnE 'def [a-z_]+\([^*)]*(flag|force|strict|verbose|dry_run)[^)]*\)' --include="*.py" src/`
- [ ] **Deprecation by docstring only — invisible to type checkers and to runtime [MEDIUM]** —
      `grep -rn -i 'deprecated' --include="*.py" src/ | grep -v '@deprecated' | grep -v 'DeprecationWarning'`
- [ ] **Does the suite fail on its own DeprecationWarnings? [MEDIUM if absent]** —
      `grep -rn 'error::DeprecationWarning' pyproject.toml setup.cfg pytest.ini tox.ini 2>/dev/null`

      float literal: measured on 3.14, `Decimal(0.1)` is
      `0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625`; pass the string `'0.1'`) ;

      (a money value typed or parsed as `float`)
- [ ] **NaN/Infinity accepted from input, divide-by-zero unguarded (§12) — MEDIUM, HIGH where
