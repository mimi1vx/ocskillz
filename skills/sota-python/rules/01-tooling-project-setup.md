# 01 — Tooling & Project Setup

For new projects and explicit modernization work: `uv` for package/env work,
`pyproject.toml` as the source of truth, Ruff for lint+format, and ty for type
checking. In an established repository, preserve its effective toolchain,
layout, and Python floor unless migration is requested.

## 1. uv is the default toolchain

Use `uv` for environments, dependency resolution, lockfiles, Python version management, and
tool running in new projects. It replaces pip, pip-tools, pipx, virtualenv, and most of Poetry.

```bash
uv init --lib mypkg            # or --app; creates src/ layout + pyproject.toml
uv add httpx 'pydantic>=2.7'   # adds to pyproject + updates uv.lock
uv add --dev pytest ruff ty    # dev dependency group
uv sync --locked               # CI: install exactly the lockfile, fail if stale
uv run pytest                  # run inside the project env, no manual activation
uv python pin 3.13             # writes .python-version
uvx ruff check .               # ephemeral tool run (pipx replacement)
```

Rules:
- **Commit `uv.lock`.** Applications MUST commit it. Libraries commit it for dev reproducibility
  even though it isn't published.
- **CI installs with `uv sync --locked`** (or `--frozen`). Never bare `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  in new projects; if a legacy `requirements.txt` must exist, generate it:
  `uv export --format requirements-txt --output-file requirements.txt`.
- **Never `sudo pip install`, never install into the system interpreter.** Every project gets its
  own venv; `uv` makes this automatic.
- One-off scripts use **PEP 723 inline metadata** instead of polluting an env:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = ["httpx", "rich"]
# ///
import httpx
```

Run with `uv run script.py` — uv resolves and caches the deps. This is the correct form for
repo maintenance scripts; reject scripts that assume "whatever is installed globally".

Governance note: Astral (uv/ruff/ty) announced its acquisition by OpenAI in March 2026; the
tools remain permissively licensed and developed in the open. The technical recommendation
stands — weigh the ownership change like any vendor dependency when standardizing.

## 2. pyproject.toml — single source of truth

For new projects, keep metadata, dependencies, and supported tool configuration in
`pyproject.toml`. Do not churn established configuration files solely to centralize them.

```toml
[project]
name = "mypkg"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = ["httpx>=0.27", "pydantic>=2.7"]

[dependency-groups]                 # PEP 735 — not extras; dev-only groups
dev = ["pytest>=9", "ruff", "ty"]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```

- Pin **lower bounds** on runtime deps; let the lockfile pin exact versions. Upper-bound caps
  (`<3`) only for deps with a history of breaking (pydantic-style major bumps) — blanket caps
  cause unsolvable resolutions downstream.
- Dev-only tooling goes in `[dependency-groups]`, not `[project.optional-dependencies]`.
  Extras are for users; groups are for developers.
- `requires-python` must match what CI actually tests. Claiming `>=3.9` while using
  `match` statements or `type` aliases is a release-blocking bug.

## 3. ruff replaces flake8 + black + isort + pyupgrade

One tool, one config block, two commands: `ruff check --fix` and `ruff format`.

```toml
[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py312"
line-length = 100
src = ["src", "tests"]

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [
  "E", "W", "F",      # pycodestyle/pyflakes
  "I",                # isort
  "UP",               # pyupgrade — keeps syntax modern
  "B",                # flake8-bugbear — real bug catchers (B006 mutable defaults, B023 loop closures)
  "S",                # flake8-bandit — security
  "C4",               # comprehensions
  "SIM",              # simplify
  "RUF",              # ruff-specific
  "ASYNC",            # blocking calls in async
  "DTZ",              # naive datetimes
  "PTH",              # pathlib over os.path
  "T20",              # stray print()
  "PERF", "G",        # perf antipatterns, logging format
]
ignore = ["E501"]      # formatter owns line length

[tool.ruff.lint.per-file-ignores]
"tests/**" = ["S101"]  # assert is fine in tests
```

- New projects use Ruff instead of adding Black, Flake8, isort, or Pylint.
- In established projects, mixed formatters are a finding only when they produce conflicting
  output or CI churn; do not migrate a working toolchain unasked.
- When Ruff owns formatting, do not also run Black over the same files.
- Treat `B`, `S`, and `ASYNC` violations as real bugs, not style noise.

## 4. Type checking — one strict checker, enforced in CI

Use **ty** as the strict checker for new projects. If an established repository already gates
mypy, Pyright, or basedpyright, use that checker unless migration is requested. Running zero
checkers is unacceptable for non-throwaway code; running two as gates often causes
contradictory suppressions, so one should be authoritative.

```toml
[tool.ty.environment]
python-version = "3.12"
```

- Every `# type: ignore` MUST carry a code: `# type: ignore[arg-type]`. Bare ignores rot.
- The checker runs in CI and fails the build. A local-only checker is not an enforced gate.

## 5. src/ layout

```
mypkg/
├── pyproject.toml
├── uv.lock
├── src/mypkg/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── py.typed          # ship type info (PEP 561)
└── tests/
```

Why: with flat layout, `import mypkg` silently picks up the working-copy directory instead of
the installed package — tests pass against uninstalled code, broken wheels ship. `src/` forces
an editable install (`uv sync` handles it) and catches packaging bugs. Tests live **outside**
the package; they aren't shipped.

Ship `py.typed` in any annotated library, or downstream checkers see your package as `Any`.

## 6. pre-commit — fast checks only

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.15.17
    hooks: [{id: ruff, args: [--fix]}, {id: ruff-format}]
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v5.0.0
    hooks: [{id: check-merge-conflict}, {id: detect-private-key}, {id: end-of-file-fixer}]
```

Keep hooks under ~5s; ty and pytest belong in CI, not pre-commit. CI must re-run the same
checks (`pre-commit run --all-files`) — local hooks are convenience, not enforcement.

## 7. Python 3.12–3.14 features worth using

- **PEP 695 type parameter syntax** (3.12) — default for new generics:
  ```python
  type JSON = dict[str, "JSON"] | list["JSON"] | str | int | float | bool | None

  def first[T](items: Sequence[T]) -> T | None: ...

  class Repo[M: BaseModel]: ...
  ```
  No more `TypeVar("T")` boilerplate, no `Generic[T]` inheritance, correct scoping for free.
- **`match` statements — judiciously.** Use for structural destructuring (AST nodes, parsed
  messages, tagged unions with a `kind` field, sum types). Do NOT use as a fancy if/elif on a
  single scalar — `if x == "a": ... elif x == "b":` is clearer and faster. Always end with
  `case _:` that raises or `assert_never(...)` for exhaustiveness (see rules/02).
- **f-string improvements (3.12, PEP 701):** nested quotes `f"{d["key"]}"`, multi-line
  expressions and comments inside `{}` are legal. Use; don't contort.
- **`itertools.batched(iterable, n)`** (3.12) — replaces hand-rolled chunking.
- **3.13:** improved REPL, clearer error messages, `warnings.deprecated` decorator,
  `copy.replace()`.
- **3.14 — deferred annotations (PEP 649/749):** forward references work without quotes or
  `from __future__ import annotations`; pydantic/FastAPI keep working (see rules/02 §10).
- **3.14 — template strings (PEP 750):** `t"..."` returns a `Template` of static parts +
  `Interpolation` objects instead of a string — for t-string-aware APIs that escape or
  parameterize values (HTML, SQL). Not a drop-in f-string; use only with a consuming library.
- **3.14 — `compression.zstd`** (PEP 784): stdlib Zstandard, also wired into
  `tarfile`/`zipfile`/`shutil`. Drops the third-party `zstandard` dep on a 3.14+ floor.

## 8. Free-threading awareness (3.13t/3.14t)

Free-threaded CPython (PEP 703, no GIL) is **officially supported since 3.14** (PEP 779) —
no longer experimental, though still not the default build; single-threaded overhead is down
to roughly 5–10%. uv installs it via the `t` suffix (`uv python install 3.14t`). Implications:

- **Stop assuming the GIL makes code thread-safe.** `dict`/`list` single ops stay atomic, but
  check-then-act sequences (`if key not in d: d[key] = ...`) were never safe and now break
  observably. Guard shared mutable state with `threading.Lock` or use queues — on every build.
- Library authors: declare support via `Py_mod_gil` / test on `3.13t` if you ship C extensions.
- Don't rewrite multiprocessing pools to threads "because no-GIL" until you've profiled on the
  free-threaded build; single-thread perf differs.
- Decision table for concurrency model is in rules/06.

## 9. Docker packaging with uv

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.14-trixie-slim AS builder
WORKDIR /app
ENV UV_COMPILE_BYTECODE=1 UV_LINK_MODE=copy
# Layer-cache deps separately from source: lockfile changes rarely, code changes often
COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv uv sync --locked --no-dev --no-install-project
COPY src/ src/
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv uv sync --locked --no-dev

FROM python:3.14-slim-trixie
RUN useradd --create-home app
USER app
COPY --from=builder --chown=app /app /app
ENV PATH="/app/.venv/bin:$PATH"
CMD ["python", "-m", "mypkg"]
```

Key points: deps installed from the lockfile *before* copying source (cache hit on code-only
changes), `--no-dev` in images, non-root user, no uv/compilers in the final stage. Pin base
images by digest for reproducible rebuilds in regulated environments.

## 10. Repo hygiene quick list

- `.python-version` committed; matches CI matrix floor.
- No `requirements*.txt` as the source of truth (generated-only is fine, mark it as such).
- No committed `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, or checker caches — `.gitignore` covers them.
- Version in exactly one place (`pyproject.toml` or `__init__.py` via dynamic) — not both.
- Entry points via `[project.scripts]`, not instructions to run `python src/mypkg/cli.py`.
