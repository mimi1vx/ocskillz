# Dead Paths — the diagnostics that expose a system reporting success while doing nothing

rules/10 asks, one control at a time, *"if this were a no-op, would anything look
different?"* This file is the **hunt**: the cheap signals that surface the family
across a whole codebase without reading every line, five classes rules/10 does
not cover (they are not security controls at all — they are correctness), and the
evidence bar a finding in this family has to clear.

Use it in AUDIT as the sweep that decides *where* to apply rules/10, and in BUILD
as the set of properties that make a stage falsifiable before you ship it.

Related: inert controls (the catalog) → rules/10; **proving a control works, and
validating the instrument or guard that reported it → rules/15**; fail-open authz
→ rules/03; truncation before inspection → rules/16 §2.7; mutation testing and
watching a test fail → `sota-testing` rules/06 and rules/09; degradation telemetry →
`sota-observability` rules/05; scale and cost → `deep-performance-audit`;
shell/CI exit-code masking → shell-scripting guidance.

## 1. The governing observation: "zero" is a legitimate answer

A bug that produces a **wrong** answer gets caught, because someone compares it
to a right one. A bug that produces **no** answer — where "none" is a valid
result — is invisible by construction.

So the hunting ground is every place where:

    failure state == a valid success state

`0 results`, `nothing to do`, `all clean`, `no changes`, `exit 0`, an empty list,
`None`, `0.0`. **If you cannot distinguish "it ran and found nothing" from "it
never ran", that is a finding — whether or not it has fired yet.**

This is rules/10 §1 turned outward: there, per control; here, per pipeline stage,
gate, job, and query.

## 2. The diagnostics, highest yield first

### 2.1 Duration, not result

**The single highest-yield tell, and the only one that needs no code reading.**
Compare each step's wall time against the work it claims to have done. A stage
reporting "0 findings" in 5 s against a 300k-LOC target did not run. A test job
that finishes in 3 s, a migration that returns instantly, a backup that completes
suspiciously fast — same signal.

```
# Time every stage, then read the ratio, not the verdict.
$ time ./scan.sh corpus/          # claims: full AST scan, 40k files
real    0m2.104s                  # ← 40k files in 2s. It did not scan them.
```

What to record in a finding: the **measured** wall time, the input size, and the
order of magnitude the claimed work implies. "Fast" is not evidence; "2.1 s for
40k files, vs 6 min for the same corpus on the previous release" is.

Two refinements:

- **Constant duration across very different inputs** is the same tell without a
  baseline: if 100 files and 100k files take the same time, size is not reaching
  the work.
- **Duration that collapses after a change** is a regression signal. A scanner
  that got 30× faster and found the same number of issues did not get faster.

**And the same arithmetic applied to your own reasoning: a rate computed over a window
longer than the phenomenon describes the window, not the phenomenon.** `sota-observability`
rules/02 §4 says averages hide what matters when you *design* a metric; this is the version
that bites when you are *debugging*, and nothing routes you there. Field-reported
2026-09-05: an importer's failures averaged **~4.2/s over an hour**, which was used to argue
"steady per-call failure, not an expired-context spin" — and on that basis a correct fix was
**retracted**. Per minute:

```
20:51..21:26   2-3 errors per minute
21:27          14,977 errors in ONE minute   (~250/s)
```

The hourly mean was arithmetically true and qualitatively backwards. Before reasoning from
a rate, look at the distribution at a resolution **finer than the event you are
hypothesising about** — a burst and a trickle produce the same mean. And where the data
carries a per-event cost, read that too: each of those failures recorded a duration of
**11–12 µs**, the signature of a cancelled context returning before any I/O. **12 µs and
12 s are different mechanisms with identical counts.**

### 2.2 Scope of the check — print the denominator

**`0 checked, 0 failed, exit 0` is the signature of this entire family.** Every
gate must report *how many items it examined*, and must fail closed when that
number is unexpectedly zero. A gate whose file glob, pathspec, or selector
drifted keeps printing green forever.

This library shipped that exact defect and fixed it (2026-07-30). The gate
enumerated skill files via `git ls-files 'skills/*/rules/*.md'`; renaming the
`rules/` directory level made the pathspec match nothing:

```
# BEFORE — pathspec mutated to match nothing:
[2/10] Every skills/*/rules/*.md ends with an '## Audit checklist'
    ok
[10/10] Every skills/*/rules/*.md is referenced by its own SKILL.md
    ok
PASS: all repository invariants satisfied.        # exit 0, examined 0 files

# AFTER — the same mutation, once each check reported its denominator:
    SCOPE EMPTY: examined 0 rules files — pathspec drift? a gate that checks
    nothing passes silently
exit=1
```

A neighbouring check that recounted the tree did **not** catch it, because the
count it recounted (`SKILL.md` files) was unaffected — worth stating as its own
lesson: *one gate's green does not cover another gate's scope.*

The commonest instance ships inside the toolchains themselves, **and they do not
agree with each other** — which is the whole point. Both verified by running them:
`go test ./...` over a package with no test files prints `? x [no test files]` and
**exits 0**; `pytest` on the same empty scope prints `no tests ran` and **exits 5**,
as it does for a file with no test functions and for a `-k` selector that deselects
everything (pytest 9.1.1). One fails closed, one fails green. So a test stage whose
selector drifts is silently green on one toolchain and loud on the next, and no
amount of folklore about "runners exit 0 when they find nothing" tells you which
you have. Gate on a floor for tests **actually executed**, never on the exit code,
and confirm your own runner's zero-collected behaviour by running it — an exit 5
that CI discards is worth exactly as much as an exit 0.

Rule for BUILD: a gate prints `ok (N items)`, and `N == 0` is a failure unless
zero is explicitly expected and asserted as such. Rule for AUDIT: for every gate,
ask what its denominator was on the last run, and whether anything would say so.

**The same arithmetic on the output side: a produced size that lands exactly on
its limit is a truncation report.** The cheapest tell in this family, and it
needs no cooperation from the producer — compare what came back against the cap
that bounded it (`output_tokens == max_tokens`, rows == `LIMIT`, bytes == the
buffer) and treat equality as truncated until shown otherwise. Field-reported
and reproduced 2026-08-19: a recon call left `max_tokens` unset, inherited a
4096 default, and a 4,843-character JSON fragment reached `json.loads` as a
plain string — no exception from the provider, no flag, and a swallowing
`except` (rules/16 §2.4) then published it as an empty profile. Corollary: **a
parse-error offset is uninterpretable without the document length.** "Failed at
char 3,023" argues *against* truncation while you assume 4,096 tokens yield
12–16k characters, and *for* it the moment you learn 3,023 was the last
character — so log the size beside the offset. Class and fix: rules/16 §2.7.

### 2.2a The empty comparand — the zero on the other operand

§2.2 asks how many items the check **examined**. This asks how many were in the
set it **compared against**, and the two fail independently. A differential
oracle — a regression snapshot, a golden file, an approval set, a "no new
findings vs. baseline" gate — computes its verdict from a *reference*, and when
that reference is empty the verdict is a constant:

```python
lost   = baseline - current    # findings we used to produce and no longer do
gained = current - baseline
return 1 if lost else 0        # non-zero on any regression
```

`lost` is drawn **from the baseline**. With an empty `baseline`, `lost` is empty
for every possible `current` — the check returns the pass value on every input,
forever, while examining a full, healthy current set and reporting a large,
*truthful* denominator. §2.2's remedy does not fire here, because nothing about
the scope is wrong. Field-reported 2026-09-05: **4 of 12** committed reference
sets were in this state, legitimately — the analysis genuinely finds nothing on
those targets, and the files are kept because a *gain* is still informative.

That is also why nobody notices: `gained` keeps working when the baseline is
empty, so the file still earns its place in the tree while half the oracle is
dead.

**The rule.** Any differential, regression or equivalence check must assert that
its reference set is non-empty **and that it loaded** — a baseline file that
failed to parse yields the same empty set through a different door — before its
result is readable as a pass, and must fail closed otherwise. Where an empty
reference is a legitimate recorded state, require an explicit, greppable opt-out
flag: the flag is how a human records that they know, and an exit code is not.

Where to look: golden-file tests with an empty golden, approval suites
(`sota-testing` rules/06 §6.4) whose approved set was never populated, gates
seeded from a baseline run that itself failed, and any `set(old) - set(new)`
regression check.

### 2.3 Cross-scale delta

Run the same stage on a small and a large input. **Output that does not grow with
input is suspect.** Findings, rows, log lines, bytes written, duration — pick a
quantity the work should move and compare the two runs. This is the cheap version
of `rules/13` §1: it catches a threshold-gated path without finding the threshold first.

### 2.4 Telemetry silence

A stage that emits no log lines cannot be distinguished from a stage that did
nothing. Silence is not evidence of health; it is absence of evidence. Any stage
on a data path emits at least a start/finish pair carrying its denominator
(§2.2). See rules/10 §3 for the degraded-control helper and the gauge that stays
1 while a control is degraded.

**The inverse also holds, and it is the harder half: speech is not evidence of health
either**, when the claim is sited *upstream* of the effect it describes. A line reading
`1 adjudicated` proves a count was computed there, not that the count survived the rest
of the function. Site the claim in the consumer, derived from the value received —
`rules/14` §1.

### 2.5 Did the changed code execute?

**After any fix, prove the new path ran.** A fix that is never reached is
indistinguishable from a fix that works — and both look like a green suite.

The cheap proof: make the new branch emit exactly once (a log line, a counter, a
one-shot `print`), run the real workload, and show the emission. **Placement is a
precondition of that proof**: an emission establishes that the line it sits on ran, not
that its result survived the suffix of the function — the filter, early return or
reassignment that comes after it. Put the emission where the value is *consumed*, or it
answers a weaker question than the one you asked (`rules/14` §1). The same trap
bites mutation testing: an editable install, a copied tree, a stale image, or
cached bytecode means the code you edited may not be the code that ran
(rules/12 §1). Assert the runtime effect before trusting any before/after result.

### 2.6 When you cannot state the right answer, state how it must change

The reason a tool emitting nothing survives review is that nobody holds an oracle
for its output. That difficulty has a name — the **test oracle problem** (Barr,
Harman, McMinn, Shahbaz & Yoo, *IEEE TSE* 41(5):507–525, 2015,
doi:10.1109/TSE.2014.2372785). You cannot write "the analyser should find 1,283
functions" for an arbitrary repository, so nothing in the pipeline contradicts
"it found 0", and §1's silent zero ships.

A **metamorphic relation** gets you an oracle anyway: you cannot state the
output, but you can state how it must *change*. Commit a fixture with N known
functions and assert the extracted count is N; add one and assert the count
rises; remove half and assert it falls. `sota-testing` rules/06 §4 owns the
technique for application code — the use here is different and cheaper. It is a
**liveness oracle for a tool whose correct output you do not know**, and it is
the one diagnostic in this file that catches an analyser emitting an
empty-but-well-formed artifact while exiting 0.

§2.3's cross-scale delta is the same idea without a fixture; the fixture buys you
an absolute assertion instead of a relative one, and it belongs in CI rather than
in an audit.

### 2.7 Provenance of the rows, not just the count

§2.2 asks a **gate** how many items it examined. This asks an **analysis** where its rows
came from — the same arithmetic one level up, and the worse failure, because the
contaminated number looks like the better one.

A sink that both the test suite and the real system write, with the same name in the same
place, is one population to every tool that reads it and two populations in fact.

Two instances, both 2026-09-02. Field-reported: of 226 log files in one directory, **215
were test fixtures**, identifiable only afterwards by a uniform verdict count and a
`[test-provider]` string — every aggregate over it was ~90% test data. And in this
library's own harness, where `evals/results/durations.tsv` received `--selftest` runs,
usage errors and real measurements alike: **46 of 60 rows were sub-10s aborts (77%)**, and
**3 of the 14 real runs had been compared against one**. The runner printed
`previous 0.1s — 6340.0x slower <-- CHECK THIS` on its first genuine measurement, and the
next real run would have read `previous 0.0s (no usable ratio)` against an abort logged 92
seconds after a good 3651.8s run — so §2.1, the diagnostic that ledger exists to
implement, was inert for the most-run runner in the repo. The cause was one line of
ordering: `note_work(len(cases))` ran *before* the `--selftest` branch, so the runner's own
scorer test recorded the same denominator as a measurement.

**The third field case is why this is a diagnostic and not a hygiene note.**
Contamination is taught as a source of false positives. There it *destroyed a true
finding* — a rate read 8.5% across the shared directory against ~100% on real runs — and
it argued more persuasively in that direction, because the contaminated aggregate carried
the larger n. "5,000 samples" outranks "149" in review, and the 149 were the real ones. A
false positive dies in review; a finding withdrawn on contaminated evidence leaves nothing
behind at all — no retraction to grep for, no red build, no second look.

Rule for BUILD: the writer stamps, not the reader — `sota-observability` rules/05 §8a.
Rule for AUDIT: every number reported from a shared sink states its **exclusion filter and
the count on both sides of it** (`149 of 5,000 after excluding test-provider runs`); a bare
n from a shared sink is not a measurement. And treat an **unexplained** jump in n when you
widen the source as contamination, not power — widening one shard to all shards
legitimately multiplies n, so the test is whether you can name where the new rows came
from. If you cannot, you did not widen the sample; you merged two populations. §2.3 reads
the same arithmetic from the other end.

## 3. Five classes rules/10 does not cover

Moved to [`rules/13`](13-context-dependent-silence.md) — scale-dependent silence,
stale-artifact no-ops, format assumptions generalised from one sample, contract
drift at an undeclared seam, and location-dependent silence. §2's diagnostics are
how you notice one; `rules/13` is what you are looking at once you do.

## 4. An assert is not a control in production

An assertion is a developer-facing invariant check. In three major runtimes it is
**removed or disabled** in the configuration production most often runs, so a
control implemented as an assert is a guaranteed no-op there. Verified
2026-07-30 by running each case:

| Runtime | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Python | `python3 -O prog.py` / `PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1` | failing `assert` vanished; program printed `passed` |
| C/C++ | `cc -DNDEBUG` | `assert(x>0)` compiled out; program printed `passed` |
| Java | default `java` (no `-ea`) | assertions are **disabled by default** at runtime |

Java's own documentation states it plainly: *"By default, assertions are disabled
at runtime"*, and once disabled they are *"essentially equivalent to empty
statements in semantics and performance"*
([Oracle, Programming with Assertions](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/assert.html)).

Rules:

- **Never** implement validation, authorization, bounds, or any
  data-integrity check as an assert. Use an explicit conditional that raises,
  returns a denial, or exits — code that survives optimisation flags.
- Asserts are fine for *impossible* internal states you want loud in development.
- AUDIT: grep for assertions on validation, authz, size, and parsing paths, then
  check what flags the **deployment** actually uses (`-O`, `NDEBUG`,
  `PYTHONOPTIMIZE`, the absence of `-ea`). A control removed by a build flag is
  the purest form of this family: source code that reads correct and does not
  exist at runtime.

Language specifics: `sota-python` rules/05, C/C++ language guidance, JVM language guidance.

## 5. Evidence — one discriminating proof per finding

Evidence must **distinguish broken from fine**. Reasoning is not evidence, and a
mechanism you did not trigger is not a confirmed finding.

| Class | The proof that discriminates |
|---|---|
| Vacuous control | **Mutation test.** Inject the exact failure the control claims to catch, run it, show it still reports green (rules/12 §1) |
| Silent zero | Show the failure return is **identical** to the success-but-empty return, and name **one consumer** that cannot distinguish them |
| Scale-dependent | State the trigger numerically; show fixtures never cross it; measure both scales where cheap |
| Stale artifact | Change the omitted input; show the key unchanged and the stale artifact reused |
| Format assumption | A **real** sample from the installed version that violates the assumption |

Label every finding exactly one of:

- **ACTIVE** — proven to have fired. Cite the log line, output, or measurement.
- **LATENT** — mechanism verified in the code; verified **not** to have fired,
  and you say how you checked. Report it; do not inflate it to ACTIVE.
- **REFUTED** — you suspected it and the evidence says no. **Report these too**:
  a refuted suspicion stops the next auditor re-raising it (`sota/rules/03` §4).

**Not findings** (disqualifiers):

- "This could fail if…" with no proof that it does, or that no guard exists.
- A control you called vacuous but never made fail.
- Any conclusion drawn from a name, comment, or docstring rather than the code.
  Comments are a **hypothesis** about behaviour and are themselves prime hunting
  ground — a comment describing a check the code does not implement is the
  canonical vacuous control.
- Anything you cannot tie to a `file:line`, a command's output, or a log line.

**Rank by blast radius × silence.** A loud partial failure outranks nothing; a
silent total failure outranks everything.

**Fix + risk — state whether the fix moves a decision boundary.** Making an inert
detector work changes what the system reports. If the fix alters a decision
boundary (a scanner that now fires, a validator that now rejects), it needs
validation against a **labelled corpus — known-bad and known-good — before
shipping**, or you trade a silent miss for a silent flood, and the flood gets the
control switched off. Say so in the finding rather than shipping the fix blind.

## 6. Where to hunt, in order

1. **Every gate**: CI jobs, pre-commit hooks, health and readiness checks,
   admission/validation webhooks, authz checks, quality gates. Mutation-test each
   one — a gate you have never seen reject anything is unverified (rules/14 §4).
2. **The tests *of* those gates**: does any test assert the gate **fails** on bad
   input? Happy-path-only tests are how vacuous controls survive review
   (`sota-testing` rules/09).
3. **Error handling on the main data path** — every catch/except between input
   and output (rules/16 §2.4).
4. **Fallback, retry, degrade, and "continue anyway" branches** — verify the
   fallback *actually engages*. A log line saying it will is not proof that it does.
5. **Shell and CI glue**: pipelines without `pipefail` mask a non-final failure;
   globs that match nothing; `find -exec` over an empty set; `|| true`; any
   command whose exit code is discarded (shell-scripting guidance).
6. **Caches, tags, fingerprints** (`rules/13` §2).
7. **Feature flags and config**: is the value **read** *and also* **applied**? A
   config field that parses, validates, and is never plumbed to the code path it
   names is a silent no-op — distinct from rules/16 §2.5, where the flag *is*
   applied, just more broadly than its name claims. Trace one flag end-to-end
   from file to the branch it is supposed to control.
8. **In-band sentinels on a compared value** — a number whose domain includes an
   "absent/unknown/error" marker (`-1`, `0`, `""`, `9999-12-31`). It defeats a
   presence check (`-1` is truthy), and because it has an **ordering** it loses
   every `<` and wins every `>`, so a guard silently skips one way and fires
   spuriously the other. Grep the *producer* — one function returning the same
   constant from a not-found branch and an error branch — then look for the
   **asymmetric guard**: a comparison with one operand filtered against the
   sentinel and the other not. That asymmetry, not the constant, is the finding
   (`sota-architecture` rules/02 §8a).

Start by enumerating every gate, guard, and audit in the codebase. For each: read
the comment, read the code, then **make it fail on purpose**. The controls you
cannot make fail are the finding.

Do one thing before any of that reading: **run every script CI, a hook, or a
runbook references, and record which produce output and which do not.** A
measurement tool nobody has executed this quarter is presumed dead until it
prints something — the ones needing credentials, a daemon, a rules directory, a
model file, or a network fail in precisely the way a clean result looks, and one
environment change (auth switched on) kills them all at once.

## 7. Then turn the lens around

Every diagnostic above is run *by* something — a script, a gate, a scorer, a
grep. Each of those is a control by the definition in §1, and the sweep is not
finished until they have been held to the same standard: **rules/12** carries the
mutation probe; **rules/15** carries the bar an instrument must clear before its
number is quoted, and the guard that is an instance of what it guards. A finding produced by an
unvalidated instrument is not yet a finding.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] **Duration recorded per stage** and compared against the work claimed —
      any stage returning "nothing found" far faster than its claimed work allows
      flagged, with the measured seconds and input size (§2.1)?
- [ ] **Every gate reports its denominator** (`ok (N items)`), and an unexpected
      **zero scope fails closed** — no `0 checked, 0 failed, exit 0` anywhere (§2.2)?
- [ ] Every **differential, regression or equivalence check asserts its reference set
      is non-empty and loaded** before its result reads as a pass (§2.2a) — an empty
      baseline makes `baseline - current` empty for every input, forever; a legitimate
      empty reference carries a greppable opt-out flag, never a silent exit code?
- [ ] Every **generated** result checked against the cap that bounded it before
      parsing (`output_tokens == max_tokens`, rows == `LIMIT`), and parse-error
      offsets logged beside the document size (§2.2)?
- [ ] Any **rate or average used in an argument** re-read at a resolution finer than the
      event it is about, and its per-event cost inspected — a burst and a trickle share a mean,
      and 12 µs vs 12 s are different mechanisms with identical counts (§2.1)?
- [ ] Cross-scale delta run on at least the stages that gate on size: output
      that does not grow with input investigated (§2.3)?
- [ ] No stage on a data path is **silent** — start/finish with counts (§2.4)?
- [ ] Any tool whose correct output cannot be stated carries a **metamorphic
      liveness check** in CI — a fixture with a known count, and an assertion
      that the count moves when the input does (§2.6)?
- [ ] After each fix, the **new path proven to have executed** (emission, counter,
      or asserted runtime effect), not just "tests pass" (§2.5)?
- [ ] Unbounded traversals/recursion/variable-length queries bounded, and every
      **size-gated path** exercised by a fixture that crosses the threshold (`rules/13` §1)?
- [ ] Truncating budgets degrade **loudly and in the returned value**
      (`coverage: partial`), never only in a log line (`rules/13` §1)?
- [ ] Every cache/tag/fingerprint key audited with "what input can change while
      the key stays constant?" — tool/ruleset **version** included (`rules/13` §2)?
- [ ] External-interface parsers validated against the **declared schema** and a
      real sample from the installed version, not one observed response; numeric
      parsing rejects trailing garbage (`rules/13` §3)?
- [ ] Every aggregate drawn from a sink that **anything but production writes to**
      states its exclusion filter and the count on both sides of it, and no finding was
      withdrawn on a number whose n grew unexplained (§2.7)?
- [ ] **No security, authz, bounds, or data-integrity check implemented as an
      `assert`**, and the deployment's flags (`-O`, `NDEBUG`, `PYTHONOPTIMIZE`,
      missing `-ea`) checked against any assert on a control path (§4)?
- [ ] Every finding carries a **discriminating proof** for its class, and is
      labelled **ACTIVE / LATENT / REFUTED** — refuted ones reported too (§5)?
- [ ] Findings ranked by **blast radius × silence**, and any fix that moves a
      decision boundary flagged as needing labelled known-bad/known-good
      validation before shipping (§5)?
- [ ] Config and feature flags traced **end-to-end**: read, validated, *and*
      applied to the branch they name (§6.7)?
- [ ] Every artifact handed **between stages** has its layout, writer and reader
      named, and any producer change validated by **running the consumer on real
      output** — not by each side's own tests (`rules/13` §4)?
- [ ] Every script CI, a hook or a runbook references **actually executed this
      pass**, the silent ones recorded as dead until proven otherwise (§6)?
- [ ] **Environment-dependent predicates**: any filter tested against an absolute
      path, hostname, username, env var or locale — each hit of
      `grep -rnE '\.parts|os\.environ|gethostname' .` near a comprehension. Run the suite from a `mktemp -d` clone, not
      the working tree; on macOS that path resolves under `/private`, which is exactly
      the component such filters tend to exclude.
- [ ] **Every collection a suite iterates has a non-empty assertion** — without one an
      empty parameter set reports SKIPPED and the suite passes vacuously.
- [ ] The tools that produced these findings held to the same standard —
      mutation probe (**rules/12**), instrument bar and guard recursion (**rules/15**) (§7)?
