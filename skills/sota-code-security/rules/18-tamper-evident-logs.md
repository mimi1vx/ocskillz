# 18 — Tamper-Evident Logs & Audit Ledgers

Scope: hash-chained audit logs, compliance trails, agent/action ledgers, signed receipts —
anything claiming "tamper-evident", "audit-grade" or "immutable" — and the signed
request/response exchanges that produce such receipts (§2). Split out of rules/04
(formerly section 8) on 2026-09-25; the section is now §1. Maps to NIST AU-9/AU-10.

Core principle: **integrity and completeness are separate claims, and an unkeyed chain
proves neither against an attacker with write access.** Primitive choice (HMAC, signatures)
stays in rules/04.

## 1. Tamper-evident logs & audit ledgers (NIST AU-9/AU-10)

Applies to anything claiming "tamper-evident", "audit-grade", or "immutable"
records: hash-chained audit logs, compliance trails (EU AI Act Art. 12; FINRA
4511, which defers to SEA Rule 17a-4(f): WORM *or* a complete time-stamped audit
trail), agent/action ledgers, signed receipts.

- An **unkeyed hash chain** (each record carries the previous record's SHA-256)
  detects accidental corruption and naive edits only — an attacker with write
  access to the store recomputes every hash and forges a clean chain. Integrity
  against an adversary needs a key or an anchor: HMAC/sign entries with a key
  held outside the store's trust domain, and/or periodically **anchor the chain
  head externally** (signed checkpoints, RFC 3161 timestamps, forward to
  WORM/SIEM, transparency-log publish).
- **Tail truncation is invisible** to chain-walk verification — deleting the
  newest N records leaves a perfectly valid chain; so does deleting an entire
  chain/stream. Detection needs an externally recorded head (hash + count),
  signed close markers, or an out-of-store registry of chains.
- **A partitioned chain must chain its partitions.** Ledgers get segmented for
  ordinary operational reasons — fixed-size epochs to bound an index, daily
  partitions, rotated files, a re-shard — and the obvious implementation starts
  each segment fresh with `prev_hash = NULL`. Deleting an entire *interior*
  segment is then undetectable: both sides of the hole verify clean and the new
  first record looks like a legitimate start. Carry the previous segment's head
  hash into the first record of the next, and have the verifier carry its
  running hash **across** the boundary instead of resetting at it — the defect
  is usually in the verifier, not the writer, which makes it a `rules/15` §3
  guard-shaped bug rather than a crypto bug. Deletion has three geometries and a
  chain walk covers only two: interior record (caught by the `prev_hash`
  mismatch), interior segment (caught **only** with boundary continuity), tail
  or whole stream (never caught by a walk — needs the external head above).
- Hash **every field you attest** — including server-assigned timestamps and
  anything used to order or attribute records. Unhashed "projection" columns
  can be rewritten without breaking the chain.
- The preimage must be a canonical, unambiguous encoding (rules/04 §7) — and "canonical"
  has to name a **spec**, not an intention: RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalization
  Scheme, June 2020, Informational) or a written encoder with its key sort,
  number format, string escaping and null/absent handling pinned. It fails in
  two directions and most guidance states only the first. **Forgery:**
  delimiter-joined concatenation of attacker-influenced fields is breakable by
  field-boundary shifting. **False alarm:** a language's default map/JSON
  encoder is not a canonical encoder — Go's spec says "the iteration order over
  maps is not specified and is not guaranteed to be the same from one iteration
  to the next", Elixir's `Map` documentation says "key-value pairs in a map do
  not follow any order", and an implementation may change that order with size
  as the map switches internal representation; float formatting, unicode
  escaping and implicit numeric→string conversion vary the same way. Identical
  data then hashes to different bytes, and the ledger reports tamper on records
  nobody touched. That is the more dangerous direction operationally: an
  integrity alarm that is wrong on ordinary traffic gets muted or ignored, and a
  muted alarm is an inert control (rules/10). Pin the encoding with a
  **known-answer test vector** committed as a fixture and reproduced by every
  implementation — without one, the off-system verifier required below is just a
  second implementation free to disagree with the first, and `chain broken` will
  not say which of them is wrong.
- **Integrity ≠ completeness.** A chain proves what was *delivered*, not what
  *happened*: records dropped before ingestion (client buffers, "never raise"
  SDKs, server-assigned sequence numbers) leave no gap. If completeness is a
  claim, attest it separately (source-assigned sequence numbers, declared
  counts, close markers) and report the two verdicts separately.
  **A TEE does not fix this** — a common and expensive wrong turn. Confidential
  computing protects a record's confidentiality and integrity *once it exists*;
  no hardware can compel a component to emit one. "Never recorded" is a
  **liveness** failure, and liveness sits explicitly outside the CC guarantee:
  the host may refuse to schedule, pause, or destroy the enclave at will
  (confidential-computing guidance, availability row; rules/04 §7
  states that any design assuming a TEE guarantees liveness is wrong). The fix is
  the separate completeness attestation above, taken at a vantage the monitored
  component does not control — see the vantage bullet below.
- Verification must be possible **off the system that stores the data**
  (standalone verifier + a documented, cross-language canonicalization spec).
  A `verify` that only runs on the server being audited proves little.
- Vantage matters: a record emitted voluntarily by the monitored component can
  be omitted at will — for security evidence prefer an independent chokepoint
  (proxy, gateway, kernel, append-only sink). See security-monitoring guidance (telemetry integrity).
- Immutable/append-only stores holding personal data need erasure designed up
  front — per-subject crypto-shredding (sota-privacy-compliance rules/03 §4);
  retrofitting deletion breaks either the chain or the law.

## 2. Signed request/response exchanges and receipts

Applies where an application signs its own messages above TLS: payment and transaction
APIs, agent-to-tool calls, inter-organisation instructions, anything whose receipt must
later prove who asked for what. Primitive choice and the canonical-encoding rule stay in
rules/04 §7; this section is about the protocol around them.

- **Sign both directions.** The client signs the request with its key and the server signs
  the response with its own; each signed body carries a fresh nonce and a timestamp, and
  the verifier rejects a stale timestamp or a nonce it has already seen. An unsigned
  response lets anyone on the path (or a compromised hosted provider) rewrite the result,
  so a client of a provider that offers response signatures verifies them.
- **Get the peer's verification key over an authenticated channel, never on first
  contact.** A key accepted from the first response it arrives with is trust-on-first-use:
  the attacker who answers first owns the session. Distribute it out of band or through a
  versioned key set you already trust (rules/04 §5 and §7).
- **A signature is not a unique identifier.** Several valid signatures can exist for one
  message and key: for ECDSA, (r, n−s) verifies wherever (r, s) does (measured 2026-09-25
  with pyca/cryptography 49 on P-256), and RFC 8032 section 8.4 notes that Ed25519 is
  non-malleable only because verification rejects S ≥ L. So de-duplicate and index replays
  on a hash of the canonical *message* (or its nonce), never on the raw signature bytes,
  and prefer libraries that enforce a canonical form.
- **Make a receipt self-describing.** Inside the signed content, record the canonicalization
  scheme, the hash and the signature algorithm identifiers and the key ID, so a verifier
  years later knows exactly what to recompute (the known-answer-vector rule of §1 applies).
- **Signatures that must outlive their key need a trusted timestamp.** RFC 3161 time-stamp
  tokens exist so a verifier can show a signature was made before the signing certificate
  was revoked or expired; without one, a key rotation or revocation retroactively voids
  every receipt it signed. Anchor such receipts as §1 describes.
- **Sign the transaction data the user confirmed**, not only the session: amount, payee and
  any field that changes the outcome, so the receipt gives integrity and non-repudiation
  for that exact instruction (rules/04 §4: never escrow the signing key).

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Is any "tamper-evident"/audit ledger keyed (HMAC/signature) or externally anchored — not a bare unkeyed hash chain — with tail truncation and whole-stream deletion detectable?
- [ ] Is ledger completeness attested separately from integrity (source-assigned seq / close markers), and is verification possible off the storing system?
- [ ] If the ledger is segmented (epochs, daily partitions, rotated files), does the first record of each segment chain to the previous segment's head **and** the verifier carry its running hash across the boundary — demonstrated against a fixture with one whole interior segment removed?
- [ ] Is the hash preimage a **named** canonicalization (RFC 8785 or a written encoder spec) rather than a default JSON/map serializer, pinned by a committed known-answer vector that every verifier implementation reproduces byte-for-byte?
- [ ] Is a TEE/confidential-computing control proposed to fix a **completeness** gap ("records that were never emitted")? That is a liveness failure and sits outside the CC guarantee — the fix is a separate completeness attestation at a vantage the monitored component does not control.
- [ ] **Are signed exchanges signed in both directions, with nonce and timestamp checked, the
      peer key obtained out of band, and replays keyed on the message rather than the
      signature (§2)?** HIGH when a signature is the replay or idempotency key:
      `grep -rniE '(seen|used|replay|dedup|idempot)[a-z_]*[^a-z].*sig|sig[a-z_]*[[:space:]]+(not[[:space:]]+)?in[[:space:]]+[a-z_]*(seen|used|replay)' .`
      — every hit that stores or looks up the raw signature is the finding; a key fetched
      from the peer on first use (`trust_on_first_use`, a `/.well-known` fetch with no pin)
      needs a per-file read.
