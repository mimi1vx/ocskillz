# Silent Control Failure — controls that look enabled and do nothing

A crash is loud and gets fixed. This file is about the opposite failure: a
control, feature, or safeguard that **appears active but has no effect** — where
a broken system and a working system are indistinguishable from the outside.
Green health checks, a passing suite, `ENFORCEMENT: ENABLED` in the startup
banner, and zero protection.

Applies in both modes. In **BUILD**, every control you add must be built so its
absence is observable. In **AUDIT**, this is a distinct pass — the classes below
are invisible to source-pattern SAST, because the code is not *wrong*, it is
*inert*.

**Proving a control here actually works is rules/12** — the mutation probe (replace
the body with the permissive no-op and watch what fails), plus the suspicion turned
on everything doing the checking: your scorers, gates and benchmarks, and the guard
that is an instance of what it guards.

**Finding these at codebase scale is rules/11** — the cheap diagnostics (duration
vs claimed work, printing every gate's denominator, cross-scale delta), plus five
classes that are correctness rather than security: scale-dependent silence, a cache
key narrower than the behaviour it gates, a parser generalised from one sample, a
producer/consumer seam no schema declares, and a filter whose predicate matches the
ambient environment (an absolute path, a hostname) so a collection is correct on one
machine and empty on another.
Sweep with rules/11 to decide *where* to apply this file.

## 1. The falsification question

For every control you write or examine, ask:

> If this were silently a no-op, would anything I can observe look different?

If the answer is **no**, that *is* the finding — whether or not the control is
currently broken. Absence of a signal is the bug. A control whose success and
whose total failure produce identical logs, identical metrics, and identical
responses is unfalsifiable, and unfalsifiable controls decay into no-ops without
anyone noticing.

**The falsification question does not catch every broken control, and the gap is
specific.** It finds controls that are *inert*. It misses controls that are **correctly
enforcing the wrong predicate** — there, something observable *does* differ (a refusal, a
missing signature, an error), so the first question answers "yes" and the control is still
wrong. Field-reported as four instances in a single session, by an author who had just
documented the shape:

| the check asked | the question that mattered |
|---|---|
| is `commit.gpgsign` true? | is a signing key configured? |
| does the encoder round-trip? | does the writer produce what the verifier expects? |
| does the `--sk` flag exist? | is `--sk` *implemented* in this binary? |
| is there a TTY? | can a PIN be collected here? |

Each substitutes an **observable proxy** for the **actual precondition**. The proxy is
easier to test, correct when written, and drifts later — because the proxy and the
precondition are configured by different people, in different files, at different times.
So ask a second question of every control:

> **The proxy question.** Is this the thing I actually depend on, or something that
> currently agrees with it? Then: *who can change one without changing the other, and
> would I find out?*

If the answer to the second is "a different file, a different person, no signal", the
predicate is a proxy and it will drift. Test the dependency itself. Where it genuinely
cannot be tested directly, **record the substitution in a comment at the site, including
the direction each error fails in** — the two directions are rarely symmetric: one instance
above blocked legitimate work when strict, and would have spent one of three PIN attempts
on a token that blocks at zero when loose. The class entry is `rules/14` §4a.

Three follow-ups that make it concrete:

- **What would I grep for at 3am** to prove this ran on request X?
- **What would break** if I deleted the control's body and returned the
  permissive value? If the answer is "nothing", nothing is holding it in place.
- **Who finds out** — a log line nobody reads is not an observer; an alert, a
  metric with a threshold, or a failing CI gate is.

This question is the organizing principle of the whole file. Every class below
is a specific way the answer comes out "no".

## 2. Where silent no-ops hide — moved to `rules/16`

The catalogue of sixteen shapes (weak existence checks, degraded optional dependencies,
swallowed exceptions, truncation into an inspector, the control that is not in force, a flag
that parses, the aggregate that masks a detection) now lives in
**[rules/16](16-where-no-ops-hide.md)**, with its section numbers unchanged — what was §2.7 here is
`rules/16` §2.7 there. This file keeps the **method**; that one is the catalogue the method
searches. Split 2026-09-12 at 484 of 500 lines.

## 3. Make degradation loud — one helper, deduped per cause

When a control cannot do its job, exactly one mechanism reports it. Scattering
ad-hoc `logger.warning` calls produces per-request noise that gets filtered, and
filtered warnings are invisible — which returns the system to silent failure.

Design:

- **One shared helper**, e.g. `control_degraded(control, reason, detail)`, used
  by every control in the codebase.
- **Deduplicate per cause, not per request** — log once per (control, reason)
  per process or per interval. Per-request warnings get rate-limited away by
  operators and stop being read.
- Emit all three signals, per `sota-observability` rules/05: a rate-limited WARN
  log, a **gauge** (`control_degraded{control="scanner",reason="model_missing"}`)
  that stays 1 while degraded, and a span/response attribute so a single
  request's degradation is traceable.
- **Surface it in the health/readiness output** — a component running without its
  enforcement path is not healthy, and "degraded" must be a distinct state from
  "ok".
- Alert on the gauge being 1 for longer than a deploy: fallbacks are for
  surviving the night, not for permanent operation.

## 4. Evidence rules for this hunt

- **Read the code in full context.** No speculation, no pattern-matching. The
  whole point of this class is that it looks fine.
- Finding format (the canonical `file:line | rule | severity | effort | fix`,
  with the middle expanded for this class): **what looks enabled | why it is
  silently a no-op | a concrete failure scenario with specific inputs/state →
  wrong behavior**.
- **If the code logs loudly or raises, it is not silent** — say so and exclude
  it. Loud failures belong to other rules files.
- **Separate "silently broken" from "documented and deliberate"** and state
  which. A metered, documented fail-open is a design decision to review, not a
  defect to report as one.
- **Say "nothing found" per category** rather than padding with weak findings.
  An honest empty category is a result.
- **A negative claim needs more proof than a positive one.** "There are no
  swallowed exceptions on the enforcement path" is a far stronger assertion than
  "here is one at `auth.py:88`" — a narrow search and a true absence look
  identical from the outside. Before asserting absence: widen the search
  (synonyms, other languages, generated code, vendored trees), use a **second
  independent method** (grep *and* AST/call-graph *and* a mutation run), and
  state the search you actually performed so the reader can judge its reach.
  That governs the **search**, which is discarded once it has answered. If the
  conclusion is instead left behind as a durable **guard**, it needs the stronger
  default in `sota-testing` rules/02 §2.10: structure in AST, behaviour by execution,
  regex only where no parser exists.
- **Before claiming a fix works**: add the regression test, then **revert the fix
  and confirm the test fails**. A regression test is not evidence until it has
  been watched to fail. Report the exact command and the pass/fail counts —
  "should work" is not evidence (router operating principle 6).
- **Check the fixture before concluding the code is broken.** A bad test input
  looks exactly like a broken detector; a validator rejecting a deliberately
  malformed test value is working as designed.
- For anything that **changes enforcement behavior**, stop and present the
  decision rather than deciding silently (router operating principle 2).

## 5. The mirror image: a control that fires too broadly

Everything above is about a control with **too little** effect. The mirror is a control with
too much: it fires on cases it was never meant to catch, **degrades the outcome it exists to
protect**, and — this is what makes it the same family — *looks like it is working the whole
time*. The inert control is invisible because nothing happens. This one is invisible because
**the thing that happens is what success looks like**.

The asymmetry is in the metric. A control's obvious health signal is *how often it fired*,
and for an over-firing control that number goes **up** as it gets worse. Blocks, denials and
redirects all get counted; the legitimate work that quietly took a worse path does not, so
the dashboard improves while the system degrades.

**The shape.** A blanket deny on a *tool* rather than on the *behaviour* — deny the search
binary instead of the unsafe search, deny the whole file type instead of the dangerous
member, deny an entire egress CIDR instead of the exfiltration path. It is easy to write,
easy to audit for presence, and it enforces a *worse* substitute: a blanket deny on a fast
literal search pushes the caller to a slower index that answers a different question, and
the caller now gets worse answers while the control reports a clean record.

**What makes it detectable.** Measure the control's **outcome**, not its firing rate:

- **A block rate has no meaning without a denominator of legitimate attempts.** "Blocked
  4,000 requests" is the numerator of an unknown fraction. The finding is the ratio, and
  you cannot get it by counting blocks — you have to sample what was blocked and read it.
- **Sample the blocked set and classify it by hand.** If a majority are legitimate, the
  control is not strict, it is broken — in the expensive direction, because the cost lands
  on the people doing the right thing and they route around it rather than report it.
- **Name the substitute.** Every deny has one: what does the caller do *instead*? If the
  answer is "a slower, less accurate or unlogged path", the control has moved the risk
  rather than removed it, and the new path is now unmonitored. A deny with no named
  substitute has not been designed, only installed.
- **A control that cannot be appealed cannot be measured.** With no exception path, the
  false positives never reach you; they become workarounds you will find in an incident.

**In BUILD, this is the falsification question run the other way** (§1): ask not only *would
anything differ if this were a no-op*, but *what legitimate case does this also catch, and
what will that caller do instead*. Both answers belong in the commit that adds the control.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] **Every deny/block/redirect control names its substitute** (§5): what does a
      legitimate caller do *instead*? A deny whose substitute is a slower, less accurate or
      unlogged path has moved the risk, not removed it — and the new path is unmonitored.
      A control installed with no answer here is a finding even while it "works".
- [ ] **No control is reported healthy on its firing count alone** (§5): a block rate is a
      numerator. Ask for the denominator of *legitimate* attempts, and for a hand-classified
      sample of what was blocked. `grep -rn 'blocked\|denied\|rejected' --include='*.md'`
      over dashboards and runbooks — a metric that rises as the control gets worse is the
      tell. No exception path means the false positives never reach you at all.
- [ ] **The proxy question asked of every control's predicate** (§1): is the tested
      condition the dependency itself, or something that currently agrees with it? Name who
      can change one without the other. A proxy with no signal on divergence is a finding
      even while it currently works.
- [ ] **Every "it produced something" assertion names the field that carries the
      detection** (`sota-code-security` rules/16 §2.16): which attribute would be empty if the detector were deleted
      but its preprocessing left intact? An aggregate over a result mixing derived
      inputs with findings is a liveness check for the input stage, not a control.
- [ ] **Every optional capability a design depends on was invoked once, not read from
      `--help`** (`sota-code-security` rules/16 §2.15). Build-tag-gated flags parse and stub out; keep the output of the
      real call. High when the capability is the load-bearing half of a security control.

- [ ] Anything that writes **outward** on a schedule (a GitOps write-back
      controller, a PR bot, a sync job) verified at the **destination** rather
      than from its own success counters — its log reports the update it decided
      to make, not the write landing (Kubernetes guidance)?

- [ ] For each security control in scope: if it were a no-op, would any log,
      metric, response, or test differ? No → finding, regardless of current
      correctness.
- [ ] Presence/enablement decided by real loaded artifacts (non-zero rule count,
      required files present), not by `exists()`/`is_dir()`/truthiness?
- [ ] No `except ImportError` (or equivalent) silently disabling a control; every
      optional dependency backing a control present in the **shipped** artifact?
- [ ] Does a loader that yields zero rules/policies fail closed and loudly? Do
      shipped example/reference configs load to a non-empty, safe state?
- [ ] Broad `except` on an enforcement path returning the permissive value?
      Grep: `except Exception`/`catch (...)`/`rescue =>`/`recover()` near authz,
      verify, validate, scan → each is fail-open, silent, or both.
- [ ] Any flag used more broadly than its own definition claims (debug/dev_mode
      also disabling a security check)?
- [ ] Any prose instruction ("do not reveal/surface", "ignore instructions
      below", authz-in-prompt) standing in for an enforced boundary over data or
      permissions that live in the same context? Enforce structurally/in code
      (rules/08 §1–2), not by instruction — `rules/14` §3.
- [ ] For each gate, does run history show it has ever **executed** (not
      all-skipped: an unreachable trigger, path/branch filter, or dead
      lifecycle event) and ever **rejected** anything? State the sample size —
      "not in the last N runs" is not "never" — `rules/14` §4.
- [ ] Early-return guards on empty/oversized/unparseable input that an attacker
      can deliberately trigger to skip inspection?
- [ ] Any truncation (`[:N]`, byte caps, `LIMIT`) on the path *into* a scan,
      validation, or signature check — or a cap on a **generator's output**
      (unset `max_tokens`, `--max-results`) whose fragment is then parsed?
- [ ] Config/policy schemas reject unknown keys, and every key in the reference
      config resolves to a real field of its section (tested structurally)?
- [ ] Security/privacy/cost-relevant defaults verified in **both** docs and code,
      with a test pinning the documented default to the parsed one?
- [ ] Numbers in tool output derived from what was actually produced, never
      printed as literals — **and every verification word** (`verified`,
      `confirmed`, `reachable`, `tainted`, `sanitized`) plus every severity or
      confidence field traceable to a line that can fail, matched by claim shape
      rather than keyword and confirmed by reading (`rules/14` §1)?
- [ ] Any control sitting in audit / warn / dry-run / report-only mode carrying
      an owner and an expiry, rather than having lived there since it shipped
      (`rules/14` §5)?
- [ ] Control smoke tests run against the **built artifact** (image/package/
      binary), not only the source checkout? Startup asserts its own required
      artifacts?
- [ ] Mutation probe run on security-critical paths, and the instrument or guard
      that reported the result validated in turn — the whole of rules/12 and rules/15?
- [ ] One shared degraded-control helper, deduped per cause, emitting log +
      gauge + health state — not per-request warnings?
- [ ] Findings state what looks enabled, why it is inert, and a concrete
      failure scenario; loud failures excluded; deliberate fail-open
      distinguished from silent bypass?
- [ ] Every "nothing found" backed by a widened search and a second independent
      method, with the search performed stated?
