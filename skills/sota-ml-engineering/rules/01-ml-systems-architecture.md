# 01 — ML systems architecture

A production ML system is mostly *not* the model. The
[Hidden Technical Debt in ML Systems](https://research.google/pubs/hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems/)
paper's famous point: the ML code is a small box in the middle of a large
system of data collection, feature extraction, serving, and monitoring — and
that surrounding system is where debt accumulates. Design the system, not just
the model.

## 1. The model is the small part

- [Rules of ML](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml)
  #1–#4: don't be afraid to ship without ML; design and implement **metrics**
  first; a **simple model with a solid pipeline** beats a sophisticated model on
  a fragile one. Get the end-to-end pipeline (data → features → train → eval →
  serve → monitor) working with a trivial model, then improve the model inside
  that frame.
- Decide the prediction architecture up front: **batch** (precompute, store),
  **online/real-time** (serve on request), or **streaming**. This drives the
  feature and serving design (`rules/05`).

## 2. Training vs serving paths

- The training path (offline, large batch, historical data) and the serving
  path (online, low-latency, current data) are different code paths over the
  same logical features. If they compute features differently, you get
  **train/serve skew** (`rules/02`) — the most common silent production failure.
- Eliminate skew structurally: a **feature store** (e.g. Feast-style) or shared
  transformation code/library used by both paths, so a feature is defined once.

## 3. Feature store

- A feature store centralizes feature definitions, computes and **versions**
  features, serves them consistently to training (offline store) and inference
  (online store), and enables reuse across models. Its core value is
  **training-serving consistency** and point-in-time-correct historical lookups
  (no future leakage in the training join).
- Not every project needs a dedicated feature store — but it needs *one*
  definition of each feature shared by both paths. Reimplementing features in
  the serving app is a skew bug waiting to happen.

## 4. Model registry & artifacts

- A **model registry** (MLflow-style) is the source of truth for trained models:
  versioned artifacts with their metrics, data/code/config lineage, deployment
  label (version **aliases** like `@champion`/`@challenger` — MLflow deprecated
  fixed staging/production/archived stages in favor of aliases and tags), and
  approver. Promotion is an explicit, gated transition (`rules/04`, `rules/05`),
  not a file copy.
- Store the model with everything needed to reproduce and explain it: training
  data reference + hash, feature versions, hyperparameters, code commit,
  environment, and eval report.
- Every change to a model (registration, alias move, promotion, rollback,
  deletion) writes an append-only audit record: who, what, when, the approval
  reference. A registry whose history can be edited in place cannot answer
  "what served on the 3rd". Fine-tuning checkpoints that may ever be evaluated
  or served are registered as their own artifacts, with their own lineage, not
  kept as loose files beside the final model (dataset lineage: `rules/02` §5).
  OWASP: AISVS 3.5.4, 12.5.3.

## 5. Reproducibility is architectural

- Any model in production must be **rebuildable**: pin data (versioned/hashed),
  code (commit), config, environment (container/lockfile), and seeds (`rules/03`).
  "We can't reproduce the prod model" is a HIGH finding — you can't debug,
  audit, or safely retrain it.

## 6. Trust domains: training, evaluation, serving

- Training, evaluation and production inference are **separate trust domains**:
  separate credentials, separate network reach, and no path by which a training
  job can write to what serving reads except through the gated registry
  promotion (`rules/04`, `rules/05`).
- Training logs, checkpoints, intermediate outputs and the experiment tracker
  hold data and near-final weights; restrict them like production data. An
  experiment tracker started with no authentication (for example `mlflow
  server` without `--app-name basic-auth`, which runs the unauthenticated
  default app) exposes every run's artifacts to anyone who can reach it.
- Compute control planes are remote code execution by design: a Ray dashboard /
  job-submission API, a notebook server or a pipeline UI (e.g. Kubeflow) that
  accepts a job runs it. None is ever reachable unauthenticated or from outside
  its trust domain. Ray's jobs API is the worked case (CVE-2023-48022: remote
  code execution; the vendor's position is "keep Ray on a controlled network");
  token auth exists only since Ray 2.52.0 and is off by default — set
  `RAY_AUTH_MODE=token` *and* keep network isolation. HIGH on sight when exposed.
- Scope feature-store namespaces by purpose, so one model's pipeline cannot read
  or overwrite another's features, and rotate the credentials that write
  materialised features on the same cadence as other production credentials
  (key-management guidance). OWASP: AI-Powered Advertising Systems Security
  cheat sheet; Secure AI Model Ops cheat sheet.

## 7. The Hidden-Technical-Debt anti-patterns

Audit for these (Sculley et al.) — each is real ML debt:

- **Entanglement / CACE** ("Changing Anything Changes Everything"): no input is
  truly independent; adding/removing a feature or changing data shifts the whole
  model. Mitigate with isolation, versioning, and monitoring of model behavior.
- **Undeclared consumers**: other systems silently depend on your model's output
  — changing the model breaks them invisibly. Declare and access-control
  consumers.
- **Feedback loops**: the model influences its own future training data (direct)
  or another model's (hidden). Detect and break them; they make offline metrics
  lie.
- **Data dependencies cost more than code dependencies**: unstable/underutilized
  input signals. Version data sources; drop unused features (`rules/02`).
- **Glue code & pipeline jungles**: most of the system becomes plumbing around a
  general-purpose package; scrappy ETL accreting into an unmaintainable jungle.
  Refactor toward clean, tested components.
- **Configuration debt**: ML systems sprawl config (features, thresholds,
  data selection). Treat config as code — reviewed, versioned, validated.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] **Reproducibility — HIGH if a prod model can't be rebuilt Is there a versioned link model
      → (data hash, code commit, config, env)?** —
      `grep -rniE 'mlflow|wandb|model.?registry|model.?card|lineage' . | head` ;
      `ls -R | grep -iE 'requirements|environment.ya?ml|poetry.lock|uv.lock|Dockerfile|conda'`
      (env pinned?)
- [ ] **Train/serve consistency — CRITICAL if features computed two ways** —
      `grep -rniE 'feature.?store|feast|transform' --include='*.py' . | head` (compare training
      feature code vs serving feature code — same source?)
- [ ] **Glue code / pipeline jungle / config sprawl — MEDIUM** —
      `grep -rniE 'TODO|FIXME|HACK|temp|quick' --include='*.py' . | grep -iE 'pipeline|feature|etl' | head`
      ; `find . -name '*.ipynb' | head` (notebook-only training/serving == debt)
- [ ] **Undeclared consumers / feedback loops — MEDIUM/HIGH (manual) Who reads the model's
      outputs? Does the model's action affect its future training data?**
- [ ] **Unused features kept in infra — LOW (Rules of ML: drop them)**
- [ ] **Trust-domain separation (§6) — HIGH** — trackers started without auth:
      `grep -rnE 'mlflow (server|ui)' . | grep -v 'app-name'`
      (each hit is a tracker with no authentication); manual: do training jobs hold
      credentials that can write serving or feature-store namespaces they don't own?
- [ ] **Append-only model audit trail and registered checkpoints (§4) — MEDIUM (manual)** —
      can the registry's history be edited or deleted by the same role that promotes? Are
      evaluated checkpoints registered with lineage, or loose files?
