# 07 — ML security & governance

ML systems have an attack surface ordinary software doesn't (the data and the
model are attackable), plus regulatory obligations. Map threats with
[MITRE ATLAS](https://atlas.mitre.org/) (adversarial tactics/techniques against
AI systems) and govern with the
[NIST AI RMF](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework). For
prompt-injection/agent threats specific to LLMs, see `sota-code-security`
rules/08 and `sota-llm-engineering`; this file covers classical-ML security.

## 1. Attacks on ML systems (MITRE ATLAS)

- **Training-data poisoning** — adversary corrupts training data (or labels) to
  degrade the model or implant a backdoor/trigger. Control data provenance and
  integrity; validate and monitor training data; restrict who/what can write to
  training sources (`rules/02`).
- **Evasion / adversarial examples** — crafted inputs at inference cause
  misclassification. Validate/bound inputs; consider adversarial training and
  detection for high-stakes models.
- **Model extraction/stealing** — querying the API to clone the model.
  Rate-limit, monitor query patterns, avoid returning raw confidence vectors
  where not needed.
- **Membership inference / model inversion** — inferring whether a record was in
  training, or reconstructing training data, from outputs/confidences. Minimize
  output granularity; consider differential privacy for sensitive training data.
- ATLAS is a living knowledge base (date-based `v2026.MM` releases since May
  2026; techniques now carry platform designations — Predictive AI, Generative
  AI, Agentic AI, Enterprise — check current); use it to enumerate threats
  during design, like ATT&CK for AI.

## 2. ML supply chain

- **Never load an untrusted model artifact.** `pickle`/`joblib`/`cloudpickle`
  execute arbitrary code on load — a malicious model file is RCE. `torch.load`
  defaults to `weights_only=True` (restricted unpickler) since PyTorch 2.6:
  `weights_only=False` or torch <2.6 is still arbitrary code execution, and even
  `weights_only=True` was bypassed to RCE on ≤2.5.1 (CVE-2025-32434, fixed in
  2.6.0) — treat it as hardening, not a trust boundary. Load models only from
  trusted, integrity-verified sources; prefer **`safetensors`**/ONNX (data, not
  code). `weights_only=False` on untrusted input is CRITICAL on sight (`rules/05`).
- Verify integrity/provenance of models and datasets (hashes, signing); pin and
  scan ML dependencies (the PyData/CUDA stack is large attack surface) — cross-ref
  the project's supply-chain controls. Beware pre-trained weights/datasets from unvetted hubs — and
  don't treat a passing pickle scan as a trust boundary: blacklist-based scanners
  (picklescan-style, used by major model hubs) were repeatedly bypassed in 2025
  (multiple CVSS 9.3 CVEs: renamed extensions, corrupted ZIP flags, subclassed
  imports). Only trusted sources + integrity verification + safe formats count.
- Protect the model registry and feature store with authn/z; a tampered registry
  ships a tampered model.

## 3. Privacy in ML

- Training data often contains personal data — minimize it, document a lawful
  basis, and honor deletion/retention (cross-ref `sota-privacy-compliance`). A
  model can **memorize** and leak training data; treat models trained on
  sensitive data as sensitive artifacts.
- Consider anonymization/aggregation, and differential privacy where the threat
  model warrants. Don't log raw PII features in monitoring (`rules/06`).

## 4. Governance & documentation

- **Model card** for each production model: intended use, training data summary,
  metrics **including per-slice** (`rules/04`), limitations, ethical
  considerations, owner. It's the artifact auditors and downstream consumers
  read.
- **NIST AI RMF** (Govern / Map / Measure / Manage) for the organizational
  process: identify context and risks, measure them (metrics, fairness,
  robustness), and manage with controls and monitoring. Treat as governance
  scaffolding, not a checkbox.
- **Fairness/bias**: assess disparate performance across protected groups
  (`rules/04`); document findings and mitigations. Bias is both an ethical and,
  increasingly, a legal requirement.

## 5. Regulatory (EU AI Act and beyond)

- The **EU AI Act** imposes obligations by risk tier; **high-risk** systems
  (e.g. employment, credit, biometric, essential services) carry requirements:
  risk management, data governance, technical documentation, logging,
  transparency, human oversight, and accuracy/robustness/cybersecurity. Determine
  your system's tier early — it shapes the whole lifecycle. Verify current
  obligations and timelines against the official text (they phase in over time).
- Sector rules may also apply (credit, health, insurance). Cross-ref
  `sota-privacy-compliance`.
