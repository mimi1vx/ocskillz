# 02 — Privacy by Design Patterns

Privacy by design means the default behavior of the system — schemas, API
contracts, access paths, settings — protects the data subject without anyone
remembering to. For systematic privacy threat elicitation (linkability,
identifiability, non-repudiation, detectability, disclosure, unawareness,
non-compliance), use LINDDUN threat modeling; this file gives the
build patterns that those threats demand.

## 1. Data minimization — the field you don't store can't leak

**Rule:** Collect a field only when a named feature needs it now. Reject "might be
useful later," "the form library includes it," and "marketing asked." For every
proposed field, require: purpose, consumer (which code reads it), retention, and
deletion path. No answer = no field.

**Rationale:** Every stored PII field has permanent carrying cost: breach blast
radius, DSAR/export surface, deletion graph edge, transfer analysis, audit scope.
Minimization is the only privacy control with negative cost.

```text
GOOD: Signup form: email + password. Date of birth requested only when the user
enables the age-gated feature, with the gate as documented purpose.

BAD: Signup form: full name, DOB, phone, gender, company, job title — "for the
profile" — where the product uses only email. Six liabilities, zero features.
```

**Minimize in dimensions, not just fields:**
- **Precision:** store city, not GPS coordinates; year of birth, not full DOB;
  truncate IPs (/24, /48) when only geo/abuse-tier matters.
- **Duration:** event-level data → aggregate after N days, drop raw (rules/03 §6).
- **Population:** sample analytics (1-in-N users) instead of recording everyone.
- **Payloads in transit:** internal services pass user IDs, not embedded user
  objects; each consumer fetches only the fields it is purpose-scoped to read.

**Fingerprinting is a tracker, and anti-bot is not an exemption.** Browser and
device fingerprints (canvas or WebGL renderer hashes, installed-font lists,
audio-context probes, mouse and scroll telemetry) identify a person as well as
a cookie does, so they go in the tracker inventory (rules/03 §2) and the privacy
notice like any other identifier (rules/01 §2). Prefer passive network-level
signals (TLS and HTTP/2 fingerprints) and reach for invasive browser signals
only on sensitive flows such as signup, login and checkout, behind consent
where ePrivacy-style law requires it. Store a keyed hash or truncated form,
never the raw signal set; keep raw signals for hours to days, then keep only
aggregates; and skip re-fingerprinting an authenticated session doing
low-risk things. OWASP: Bot Management and Anti-Automation cheat sheet.

**API design corollary:** responses return the minimal projection per consumer.
A `GET /users/{id}` that returns 40 fields to every internal caller makes every
caller part of the PII surface. Use field masks / per-audience DTOs / GraphQL with
field-level authorization.

```typescript
// GOOD: explicit per-audience projections — adding a column to the table
// changes NO response until someone deliberately adds it to a DTO
const PublicProfile  = pick(User, ['id', 'displayName', 'avatarUrl']);
const SupportView    = pick(User, ['id', 'displayName', 'email', 'createdAt']);
const BillingView    = pick(User, ['id', 'email', 'countryCode']);

// BAD: res.json(user) — serializes the ORM entity; the day someone adds
// `internal_risk_score` or `date_of_birth` to the model, every consumer
// (and every consumer's logs) receives it. Disclosure by default.
```

## 2. Purpose limitation in code

**Rule:** Purpose is machine-readable metadata bound to data (rules/01 §1) AND an
access-control dimension. A service or job declares the purposes it serves; access
to purpose-tagged data outside a declared purpose is denied or at minimum audited.

```python
# GOOD: purpose is an explicit, logged dimension of data access
@requires_purpose("fraud_detection")           # declared in service manifest,
def get_payment_history(user_id, ctx):         # checked against field purpose tags,
    ...                                        # recorded in the access log

# BAD: any authenticated internal service reads any column; "purpose" exists only
# in the privacy policy. Marketing job quietly reads fraud-purpose device data —
# nothing stops it, nothing records it.
```

Pragmatic ladder (adopt the highest rung you can sustain):
1. Purpose tags in catalog + code review enforcement (minimum).
2. Separate credentials/roles per purpose-bound consumer; DB grants per
   view/column group using engine-native column/row-level controls.
3. Purpose claim in service-to-service auth tokens, enforced at the data API,
   producing per-purpose access logs (gold standard; also makes DSAR "who accessed
   my data and why" answerable).

**Repurposing is a change event:** using existing data for a new purpose (e.g.,
training an ML model on support tickets) requires a catalog purpose update,
compatibility/lawful-basis review, and possibly consent re-prompt — encode this as
a required review on purpose-tag diffs.

## 3. Pseudonymization, tokenization — and why most "anonymization" fails

**Definitions that matter legally and technically:**
- **Pseudonymized:** identifiers replaced, but a mapping (key, table, or feasible
  linkage) exists. Still personal data under GDPR (Recital 26) for the controller
  holding the key. Valuable as a security measure; changes nothing about
  DSAR/deletion obligations. For a *recipient* without means to re-identify, the CJEU
  held it may not be personal data (C-413/23 P *EDPS v SRB*, 4 Sep 2025, para 86,
  under Reg. 2018/1725) — a counsel question, never a reason to descope a transfer
  on your own; the test below is stricter than the Court's, deliberately.
- **Anonymized:** re-identification not reasonably likely by any party with any
  auxiliary data — only then does data leave GDPR scope. This bar is far higher
  than engineers assume.

**Common failures to flag on sight (each is a finding, not a nitpick):**

| Claim | Why it fails |
|---|---|
| "We hash the email (SHA-256), so it's anonymous" | Deterministic hash of a low-entropy identifier = trivially reversible by dictionary; also still linkable across datasets — it IS a pseudonymous ID |
| "We removed names and emails" | Quasi-identifiers remain: ZIP + birthdate + gender uniquely identifies most of a population; timestamps + location traces are fingerprints |
| "It's just internal user IDs" | Linkable to identity via any join; pseudonymous, not anonymous |
| "We aggregated it" | Small cells (count < k), max/min values, or repeated overlapping queries re-identify; differencing two aggregates isolates one person |

**k-anonymity basics (use as a floor, not a guarantee):** a release is k-anonymous
if every quasi-identifier combination matches ≥ k records. Enforce via
generalization (age → 5-year bands), suppression (drop rare combinations), and
minimum cell-size thresholds on any exported aggregate (k ≥ 10 is a common floor;
pick per risk). Know the limits: homogeneity (all k records share the sensitive
value) and auxiliary-data attacks still break it — which is why "anonymized"
requires a documented review with attack assumptions, not a checkbox.

**Tokenization:** replace the sensitive value with a random token; the vault
holding the mapping becomes the high-security zone, and downstream systems fall
out of sensitive scope. This is THE PCI DSS descoping move (rules/04 §4) and works
for SSNs/bank details too:

```text
GOOD: checkout posts card → tokenization service/PSP; app DB stores tok_8f3a...;
fraud, refunds, reporting all operate on tokens. PCI scope = the vault + capture
path, not your whole platform.

BAD: orders table stores PAN "for refund convenience" → entire DB, its backups,
its replicas, every service with DB access, and every admin laptop with a SQL
client are now in PCI scope.
```

Format-preserving encryption is a variant when downstream systems require the
original format; apply rigorous key lifecycle management.

**If you need a linkable pseudonym, build it honestly** — keyed, salted,
rotatable, scoped — not a bare hash:

```python
# GOOD: keyed pseudonymization — per-context key from KMS; unlinkable across
# contexts; rotating the key severs all linkage (a deletion lever)
def pseudonym(user_id: str, context: str) -> str:
    key = kms.get_key(f"pseudo/{context}")          # per-purpose key, access-logged
    return hmac_sha256(key, user_id).hex()[:32]

# BAD: sha256(email) — dictionary-reversible (emails are low-entropy),
# globally linkable (same input → same output everywhere, forever),
# irrevocable (no key to rotate or destroy). This is a tracking ID, not privacy.
```

Per-context keys give you compartmentalization (analytics pseudonyms can't join
against support pseudonyms) and a kill switch (destroy the context key →
pseudonyms in that context become unlinkable noise — crypto-shredding's cousin,
rules/03 §4).

## 4. Differential privacy & privacy-preserving analytics — when aggregates are exposed

**Rule:** If you expose statistics computed over personal data (public dashboards,
customer-facing benchmarks, partner data shares, published research), per-record
suppression is not enough — use differential privacy (calibrated noise with a
privacy budget) or strict k-thresholding with query auditing. DP is the only
approach with a formal guarantee against differencing attacks; mature libraries
(OpenDP, Google DP building blocks) make it practical for counts/sums/means.
Don't hand-roll noise mechanisms; budget composition is where amateurs leak.

```sql
-- GOOD: aggregate endpoint with k-threshold enforced in the view itself,
-- so no caller can extract small cells
CREATE VIEW public_usage_stats AS
SELECT region, plan, count(*) AS users, avg(events_30d) AS avg_activity
FROM   accounts GROUP BY region, plan
HAVING count(*) >= 10;            -- cells under k are suppressed, structurally

-- BAD: the dashboard API accepts arbitrary filters over raw events; an analyst
-- (or a partner with API access) filters to zip=94110 AND age=87 AND plan=pro
-- → cohort of one. Re-identification by query, no breach required.
```

**Decision ladder for analytics generally (prefer the earliest viable rung):**
1. Don't collect (feature flags + server metrics may answer the question).
2. Collect aggregates only, client-side or at ingestion (no event-level PII at rest).
3. Event-level, first-party, pseudonymous, short raw retention (e.g., 90 days →
   aggregate), no third-party sharing.
4. Third-party analytics: processor with DPA, EU-hostable if needed, IP truncation
   on, identify-calls minimal (rules/01 §4).
Session replay and heatmap tools deserve special suspicion: they exfiltrate form
contents and screens wholesale — require explicit masking allowlists, not blocklists.

## 5. Default-private settings

**Rule:** Every setting affecting personal-data exposure defaults to the most
private option (GDPR Art. 25 "data protection by default"). Visibility = private;
optional analytics/marketing = off until consent; discoverability (search by
email/phone) = opt-in; new fields excluded from existing exports/shares until
reviewed.

```text
GOOD: new "activity status" feature ships default-off with a consent-gated toggle.
BAD: profile photos default public "for engagement"; telemetry opt-out buried in
settings; new column auto-included in the partner data feed because the export
does SELECT *.
```

That last one is an architectural rule: **no `SELECT *` across trust boundaries.**
Exports, feeds, webhooks, and API responses enumerate fields explicitly so that
adding a column never silently widens disclosure.

## 5b. Network-level privacy — remote content leaks the IP address

**Rule:** Content fetched from a host the user did not choose (avatars and
signature images hot-linked from another domain, images in feeds or comments,
embeds, images inside HTML email) tells that host the reader's IP address,
user agent and the moment they looked. Anyone who can post a link can run that
host, so it is a de-anonymisation and read-receipt channel as well as a
tracking one. Give users a setting that stops third-party content from loading.
For rendered HTML email, block remote content by default. When it has to be
shown, fetch it through your own proxy so the origin sees the proxy, not the
reader, and strip cookies and referrer on that request.

```text
GOOD: webmail rewrites <img src="https://x.example/p.gif"> to a "load images"
placeholder; on click it loads via /img-proxy?u=... with no cookies.
BAD: forum lets posts embed <img src> from any domain; the poster watches
their server log for the IP of the moderator who opened the report.
```

## 5c. Coercion-resistant design for at-risk users

**Rule:** If the product serves people who may be forced to unlock it (activists,
journalists, people living with an abuser, users crossing hostile borders),
consider an optional duress credential. Entering it in place of the real one
hides a pre-chosen set of sensitive data, wipes it, or opens a decoy account,
depending on the product. It only protects anyone if the adversary cannot tell
it apart from a normal session:
- ordinary, non-sensitive features keep working inside it (mail still sends,
  the feed still loads);
- either a further duress mode can be created from inside it, so an attempt
  to create one does not reveal that you are already in one, or duress modes
  are set up only out of band so no in-app control hints that one exists;
- nothing observable differs: no distinct login timing, error text, session
  flag in client-visible state, or entry in a user-visible activity log.
Treat the duress path as a security feature with its own threat model
(threat modeling); a discoverable panic mode can put the user at greater
risk than none. OWASP: User Privacy Protection cheat sheet.

## 6. LINDDUN threats → build patterns (quick map)

When a LINDDUN session raises a threat, these are the
default mitigations in this skill:

| LINDDUN threat | Primary mitigation here |
|---|---|
| Linkability | Per-context pseudonyms (§3), purpose-scoped access (§2), compartmentalized keys |
| Identifiability | Minimization/precision reduction (§1), k-threshold & DP on releases (§4) |
| Non-repudiation (user can't deny) | Minimize identity binding in records; aggregate where intent allows |
| Detectability (existence leaks) | Uniform responses/timing on lookup APIs; don't confirm account existence |
| Disclosure of information | Projections (§1), tier-bound encryption & access (rules/01 §2) |
| Unawareness | Notices + consent records at collection (rules/03 §1), default-private (§5) |
| Non-compliance | Catalog + CI gates (rules/01), retention automation (rules/03 §6) |

## 7. Retrofit order for existing systems (AUDIT → remediation)

When auditing a system that was not built this way, recommend remediation in this
order (highest risk-reduction per effort first):
1. Stop the bleeding: kill unpurposed collection, PII logging, `SELECT *` exports.
2. Tokenize/segregate the highest-tier data (cards, special-category) to shrink scope.
3. Add retention enforcement (rules/03 §6) — drains the historical pool.
4. Bind purpose/classification annotations + CI gate (rules/01) — stops regression.
5. Tighten access to purpose-scoped roles.
6. Re-evaluate claimed anonymization with §3's failure table.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Every collected field traces to a named feature/purpose; sample 10 fields and demand the consumer code path
- [ ] Precision minimized where full precision is unused (GPS, full DOB, full IP)
- [ ] Internal APIs return minimal projections; no whole-user-object passing or `SELECT *` across trust boundaries
- [ ] Purpose tags exist and are enforced by at least code review; access roles segmented by purpose for high tiers
- [ ] New-purpose reuse of existing data triggers a documented review (check git history of purpose tags)
- [ ] No "anonymized" claim rests on hashing identifiers or removing direct identifiers only; quasi-identifier risk assessed, k-threshold on aggregate releases
- [ ] Cardholder/SSN-class data is tokenized or vaulted; verify no raw values in app DB, logs, or backups
- [ ] Public/partner-facing aggregates use DP or k ≥ threshold with documented rationale
- [ ] All privacy-affecting settings default private/off; check the three most recent features
- [ ] Session replay / heatmap tooling absent or mask-allowlisted and consent-gated
- [ ] Browser/device fingerprinting (canvas, WebGL, fonts, behavioural telemetry) is listed in the tracker inventory and privacy notice, used only on sensitive flows, consent-gated where required, stored hashed/truncated with hours-to-days raw retention (§1) — MEDIUM. Probe: `grep -rnE "toDataURL\(|UNMASKED_RENDERER_WEBGL|WEBGL_debug_renderer_info|@fingerprintjs|FingerprintJS" .`
- [ ] Third-party remote content (hot-linked avatars, feed images, embeds) can be blocked by the user; rendered HTML email blocks remote content by default or loads it through a proxy (§5b) — MEDIUM. Probe for HTML email rendered straight into the page: `grep -rnE "(innerHTML|dangerouslySetInnerHTML|v-html)[^;]*(mail|message)[A-Za-z_.]*(html|body)" .` — each hit must show the remote-content rewrite or proxy
- [ ] Where the user base includes people at risk of coercion, a duress credential or panic mode was considered; if built, it is indistinguishable from normal use (§5c) — judgment, no probe
