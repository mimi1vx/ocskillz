# 01 — Structured Logging

Logs exist to answer questions during incidents. Every rule here optimizes
for one reader: an on-call engineer with a trace ID and 5 minutes.

## 1. Emit JSON, one event per line

Machine-parseable structure is non-negotiable. String interpolation destroys
queryability; you cannot `WHERE user_plan = 'enterprise'` on prose.

**Bad:**

```python
logger.info(f"User {user.id} checked out cart {cart.id} for ${total} in {ms}ms")
```

**Good:**

```python
logger.info("checkout_completed",
    user_id=user.id, cart_id=cart.id,
    amount_usd=total, duration_ms=ms)
```

Rules:
- Static, snake_case event name as the message; everything variable goes in
  fields. The message is a grep key, not a sentence.
- Consistent field names across the codebase: `duration_ms` everywhere, never
  a mix of `elapsed`, `time_taken`, `latency`. Maintain a field dictionary;
  prefer OTel semantic convention names (`http.response.status_code`,
  `db.system.name`) where they exist.
- Typed values: `duration_ms: 142` (number), not `"142ms"` (string). Units in
  the field name, not the value.
- Timestamps in UTC ISO-8601 or epoch nanos, emitted by the logger, never
  hand-formatted.
- A timestamp is only as good as the clock behind it. Every host that emits
  logs, and every collector, syncs time (chrony, systemd-timesyncd, or the
  cloud provider's time service), and drift is **alerted on**, not assumed —
  with node_exporter the `timex` collector exports `node_timex_sync_status`
  (1 = synchronised) and `node_timex_offset_seconds`. Without it, a timeline
  rebuilt across hosts during an incident puts cause after effect. Where sync
  cannot be guaranteed (browsers, mobile and edge devices, customer
  appliances), keep the source's claimed time *and* the time the pipeline
  received it — the OTel log data model has `Timestamp` and `ObservedTimestamp`
  for exactly this — or record the measured offset, and never order security
  events on the untrusted clock alone. OWASP: ASVS 5.0 V16.2.2, Logging cheat
  sheet, Proactive Controls 2024 C9.
- **When it happened is not when it was written.** Anything that emits later
  than it acts — a queue consumer, a batch uploader, an offline client syncing,
  a replay or backfill — stamps the event with the time the action occurred,
  carried from the source, and lets the logger or pipeline add its own emit or
  receive time beside it. Stamping "now" at emission puts a 3am login at the
  9am sync in the timeline. In the OTel log data model `Timestamp` is the
  origin's time (optional, may be absent) and `ObservedTimestamp` is when the
  collection system saw it; exporters to one-timestamp formats use `Timestamp`
  if present, else `ObservedTimestamp`. So a Collector transform that runs
  `set(log.time, log.observed_time)` unconditionally erases the event time;
  guard it (`where log.time_unix_nano == 0`) so it only fills a gap. OWASP:
  Logging cheat sheet.
- Multi-line payloads (stack traces) belong in a single JSON field
  (`exception.stacktrace`), never as raw multi-line output that shreds into
  N orphan lines in the aggregator.

## 2. Levels: ERROR means a human must act

Level discipline is the upstream of alert discipline. If ERROR is noisy,
error-rate alerts are noise, and on-call learns to ignore both.

| Level | Contract | Examples |
|-------|----------|----------|
| FATAL | Process cannot continue; exits after logging | Config invalid at boot, can't bind port |
| ERROR | Unexpected failure; a human should investigate; counts toward error-rate SLIs | Unhandled exception, dependency hard-down after retries, data corruption detected |
| WARN | Degraded but self-handled; investigate if it trends | Retry succeeded, fallback used, deprecated API called, near a limit |
| INFO | Business-significant state change; the wide event lives here | Request completed, job finished, config reloaded |
| DEBUG | Developer detail; off or heavily sampled in prod | Cache decision, intermediate values |

**Bad** (expected events at ERROR — trains everyone to ignore ERROR):

```go
if errors.Is(err, sql.ErrNoRows) {
    log.Error("user not found", "user_id", id) // expected outcome, not an error
}
log.Error("retrying request, attempt 2/5")     // handled; WARN at most
log.Error("invalid input from client")          // client's bug → 4xx, INFO/WARN
```

**Good:** client errors (4xx) are INFO/WARN with the status in the wide
event; retries are WARN only on final failure being near; ERROR is reserved
for "this should never happen and someone must look."

Never log-and-rethrow at every layer — one exception must produce one ERROR
line (at the boundary that handles it), not five duplicates that quintuple
your error rate.

**Level governance.** The production default level must already record what
the business and compliance need — nobody should have to raise it after an
incident to find out what happened. The security/audit stream is not governed
by the operational level at all: route it through its own logger or handler
that a level change (global, root or per-package) cannot silence. Changing the
level at runtime goes through an approved path — a change record, or an
automatic rule that raises verbosity for a bounded window and reverts on a
timer — and the toggle itself is an authenticated, audited admin action
(rules/05 §3). A scheduled check compares the level each running instance
actually reports with the intended one, because a "temporary" DEBUG or OFF
outlives the incident that caused it. OWASP: Logging cheat sheet.

## 3. Correlation: trace_id in every line

A log line that cannot be joined to a request is gossip. Inject IDs from
context automatically — never pass them by hand.

```python
# Python: contextvars-based injection (structlog)
structlog.configure(processors=[
    structlog.contextvars.merge_contextvars,  # trace_id, request_id auto-attached
    ...,
    structlog.processors.JSONRenderer(),
])

# Middleware, once:
ctx = trace.get_current_span().get_span_context()
structlog.contextvars.bind_contextvars(
    trace_id=format(ctx.trace_id, "032x"),
    span_id=format(ctx.span_id, "016x"),
)
```

Rules:
- Use the active OpenTelemetry trace_id as the correlation ID. Do not invent
  a parallel `request_id` scheme if tracing exists; if you must keep a legacy
  request_id, log both.
- Propagate into async work: thread pools, queue consumers, cron-spawned
  tasks must restore context before logging (see rules/03 §4).
- Also bind stable dimensions once per request: `user_id` (if policy allows),
  `tenant_id`, `service.version`, `deployment.environment.name` — via logger
  context, not repeated at every call site.
- Audit test: pick any prod log line; you must be able to retrieve the full
  request trace and all sibling logs from it. If not, correlation is broken.

## 4. Redaction at the logger — secrets and PII never reach the sink

Call-site vigilance fails; the 200th engineer will log the request object.
Enforce centrally, fail closed.

**Bad:**

```js
logger.info({ headers: req.headers }, 'login attempt');   // Authorization, cookies
logger.debug(user, 'user object');                        // email, address, hash
catch (e) { logger.error({ request: e.config }, 'payment failed'); } // card data in axios config
```

**Good** (pino) — a key scrub at any depth and case, because `redact.paths`
are exact-depth and case-sensitive (`*.authorization` misses
`req.headers.authorization`, `*.password` misses a top-level `password`
and `req.body.password`, and neither sees axios's `Authorization`):

```js
const SENSITIVE = /pass|secret|token|authorization|cookie|api.?key|ssn|card|email|address|hash|salt|^(data|body)$/i;
const scrub = (v, seen = new WeakSet()) => {         // any depth, any case
  if (v === null || typeof v !== 'object') return v;
  if (v instanceof Date) return v.toISOString();     // Object.entries(Date) is empty
  if (v instanceof Error)                             // allowlist: drops config,
    return { type: v.name, message: v.message, code: v.code, stack: v.stack }; // request._header
  if (seen.has(v)) return '[Circular]';
  seen.add(v);
  if (Array.isArray(v)) return v.map((x) => scrub(x, seen));
  const out = {};
  for (const [k, x] of Object.entries(v))
    out[k] = SENSITIVE.test(k) ? '[REDACTED]' : scrub(x, seen);
  return out;
};
// formatters.log does not see child() bindings: logger.child(scrub({...}))
const logger = pino({ formatters: { log: (obj) => scrub(obj) } });
```

Rules:
- Layered defense: (1) typed serializers per domain object that emit an
  explicit allowlist of fields (`user → {id, plan}` only); (2) logger-level
  denylist for known key patterns (`password|token|secret|authorization|
  cookie|ssn|card`); (3) pipeline-level scanner (OTel Collector
  `transform`/`redaction` processor, or vendor DLP) as the last net.
- Never log: credentials, session tokens, API keys, full request/response
  bodies by default, `Authorization`/`Cookie` headers, PII beyond opaque IDs
  (email, name, address, IP where regulated), card/bank data (PCI scope
  contamination), encryption keys, signed URLs.
- Exceptions are caught objects too: exception messages and locals can embed
  connection strings and tokens. Scrub exception serializers as well — an
  axios error's `request._header` is the raw header block as one string, so
  no key match reaches it; serialize errors from an allowlist.
- Test the redaction, not the config: log every known-bad shape above through
  the real logger and assert no secret value appears in the output.
- A secret found in logs is an incident: rotate the secret AND purge the log
  history; retention means the leak persists for the retention window.

## 5. Wide events: one canonical log line per unit of work

The single highest-leverage logging practice. Instead of 15 scattered
breadcrumb lines per request, emit ONE rich event at completion carrying
everything needed to characterize that request.

**"At completion" is doing real work in that sentence.** A line emitted mid-function
attests only that *that line ran* — not that its result survived the filter, early
return, exception path or reassignment that follows it. A count computed from a
collection the function later discards is still a computed count, and still false: one
real case logged `1 adjudicated` for weeks after the `return` beneath it stopped
including that collection. So **site a claim where the value is consumed**, derived from
what was actually returned or written: a producer may log its *intent*, only the
consumer can report the *effect*. Verify it by changing what the function returns and
reading the emitted line — for anything running unattended (cron, pipeline stage, agent
loop) the log is the **only witness**, so a log unchanged by that mutation is the
finding. Full class: `sota-code-security` rules/14 §1. Scattered lines force
join-by-timestamp archaeology; the wide event makes "show me slow checkouts
for enterprise tenants on v2.14" a single query.

```json
{
  "event": "http_request",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-12T03:14:07.121Z",
  "trace_id": "4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736",
  "http.request.method": "POST",
  "http.route": "/api/v2/checkout",
  "http.response.status_code": 502,
  "duration_ms": 4312,
  "outcome": "error",
  "error.type": "UpstreamTimeout",
  "user_id": "u_8a2f",
  "tenant_id": "t_acme",
  "tenant_plan": "enterprise",
  "cart_items": 7,
  "amount_usd": 1249.00,
  "payment_provider": "stripe",
  "retries.payment": 2,
  "cache.hit": false,
  "db.queries": 11,
  "db.total_ms": 220,
  "upstream.payment_ms": 4002,
  "feature_flags": ["checkout_v3"],
  "service.version": "2.14.1",
  "region": "eu-west-1"
}
```

Rules:
- Build the event incrementally: middleware creates a per-request accumulator
  at start; handlers and clients attach fields (`evt.set("cache.hit", true)`);
  middleware emits once in a `finally` — including on exceptions, where it
  must still fire with `outcome=error` and error fields.
- Include: identity (trace_id, route, method), outcome (status, error.type),
  timing breakdown (total + per-dependency ms), business context (tenant,
  plan, amounts, flags), infrastructure (version, region, instance).
- High dimensionality is the point — many fields per event is good. (High
  *cardinality* is fine in logs/events; it is only forbidden in metric
  labels — see rules/02 §3.)
- Same pattern for non-HTTP work: one event per consumed message, per job
  run, per batch — with queue lag, attempt number, batch size.
- Wide events at INFO are never sampled away independently of their request;
  breadcrumb DEBUG logs are the sampling target.

## 6. Sampling and cost discipline

Log spend is real money and real signal-to-noise. Defaults that are safe at
10 rps bankrupt you at 10k rps.

Rules:
- Never sample: ERROR/FATAL, wide events for failed or slow requests, audit/
  security logs (separate stream, longer retention, stricter access).
- Sample aggressively: DEBUG breadcrumbs on hot paths, wide events for
  boring successes (e.g. keep 1–10% of fast 2xx health-adjacent traffic),
  repeated identical WARNs (log-once-per-N or token bucket per event key).
- Sample per-trace, not per-line: keep or drop ALL logs of a request
  together (key the decision on trace_id, or follow the trace sampling
  decision), otherwise you get unjoinable fragments.
- Loops: never log per-item at INFO. Log batch start/end with counts, and
  per-item only at sampled DEBUG or on failure.

```python
# Bad: 1M lines per batch run
for row in rows:
    logger.info("processing row", row_id=row.id)

# Good: 2 lines + failures
logger.info("batch_started", batch_id=b, total=len(rows))
... # per-row only on failure, at WARN, with row_id
logger.info("batch_completed", batch_id=b, ok=ok, failed=failed, duration_ms=ms)
```

- Tier storage: hot/searchable 7–30 days; archive to object storage for
  compliance; route DEBUG to a cheap or ephemeral sink. Set retention per
  stream deliberately, not platform-default.
- Review the top-10 log producers (by volume and by cost) monthly; the top
  emitter is usually a forgotten DEBUG line or a health check being logged.
  Don't log load-balancer health-check requests at INFO at all — in the
  **operational** stream. The security/audit stream is different: see §7.

### 6a. The logging path under attack and under failure

The logger is an input-driven resource like any other: if a request can cause
a log line, an attacker can cause a million.

- **Bound attacker-triggerable volume.** Rate-limit per source and per event
  key (failed logins per client, validation errors per route) — emit a
  summary (`suppressed=N` over the window) instead of every repeat. Give the
  buffer, queue and local disk hard caps, and shed in priority order: DEBUG
  first, operational INFO next, security/audit events last. Shedding is
  itself a signal: count dropped records per level as a metric and alert on
  any drop in the security stream.
- **Unbounded queues move the outage, they do not remove it.** Python's
  `queue.Queue()` with the default `maxsize=0` is infinite, so a flood grows
  memory until the process dies; a bounded queue behind `QueueHandler` raises
  `queue.Full` on `put_nowait`, which the handler routes to `handleError` —
  the record is lost with a traceback on stderr and the app carries on
  (measured, CPython 3.14). Choose that trade deliberately, and count it.
- **No interleaved records.** Many threads or processes writing one sink must
  go through a single writer (one queue plus one listener thread, or the
  collector reading per-process stdout), not N handles on one file. POSIX
  only promises that pipe writes of at most `PIPE_BUF` bytes are not
  interleaved — a stack trace is larger than that, and a regular file shared
  between processes has no such promise.
- **Test the failure modes, and write down the answer.** Cover: sink
  unreachable, disk full, write permission removed, and the logger itself
  throwing (a serializer raising on an odd object). For each, the test
  asserts that the request still succeeds (logging never crashes the app) and
  that a security event is either delivered, buffered, or its loss is counted
  and alerted — never silently gone. Where a security event cannot be
  recorded at all, decide explicitly whether that operation fails closed.

## 7. What NOT to log

- Secrets/PII (§4) — ever.
- Per-iteration loop spam, poll ticks, "entering function X" tracing — that's
  what spans and profilers are for.
- Full request/response bodies by default. If a payload is needed for
  debugging, log it size-capped, sampled, redacted, behind a flag.
- Health-check and readiness probe traffic at INFO — operational stream only.
- **The exception: do not filter known actors out of the security stream.**
  Internal systems, uptime monitors, crawlers, scanners and pen testers are
  exactly who an attacker pretends to be, and a filter keyed on a User-Agent
  (`kube-probe/…`, which the kubelet sets unless the probe defines its own
  header) or a source IP is a free pass for anyone who copies it. Keep their
  security and audit events and tag them instead (`actor.class=monitor`,
  `actor.class=pentest` with the engagement ID), so dashboards can exclude
  them and investigations can still see them. OWASP: Logging cheat sheet.
- Duplicate error reports up the call stack (§2).
- Anything you wouldn't show a contractor with log access: logs are your
  widest-read datastore with your weakest access control.

## 8. Protect the log store: access, placement, transport

Logs hold the evidence an intruder most wants to read or erase, so the store
gets the controls of a sensitive database. Integrity and tamper evidence are
`sota-code-security` rules/18; this section is who reads, where files live,
and how records travel.

- **Reads are events too.** Record every query or export against the log
  store (who, what scope, when) in a stream the reader cannot edit, and alert
  on unusual readers or bulk exports. Read privilege is granted per role, may
  need prior approval, and is re-reviewed on a schedule — stale access to logs
  is stale access to everything the logs leaked.
- **File logs, when unavoidable,** go on a partition or volume of their own,
  apart from the OS, the application code and user-uploaded content, so a log
  flood cannot fill the system disk and an upload path cannot reach the logs.
  The directory is owned by the writing service account and closed to other
  users (e.g. `0750`), files are not world-readable (e.g. `0640`), and the
  web server never serves that path.
- **Encrypt and authenticate the hop.** Any shipment across a network you do
  not fully control uses TLS with certificate verification. Where a forged
  event could drive a decision or hide an attack, verify the sender too: mTLS
  or signed events from each source. In the OTel Collector, a receiver's
  `tls.client_ca_file` makes it require and verify client certificates; on an
  exporter, `insecure: true` turns TLS off and `insecure_skip_verify: true`
  keeps TLS but skips server-certificate checks (both default to false).
  Events from clients and other trust zones stay untrusted input
  (`sota-code-security` rules/07 §2).

## Audit checklist

- [ ] All services emit JSON (or otherwise structured) logs; no printf prose
      on production paths.
- [ ] Field names consistent across services; a field dictionary or OTel
      semantic conventions are followed.
- [ ] Sample 20 ERROR lines from production: every one represents something
      a human should act on. No expected 4xx/no-rows/retry noise at ERROR.
- [ ] Every production log line carries trace_id (or correlation ID); IDs
      flow into async/queue/cron work.
- [ ] Redaction enforced at logger/pipeline level, not call sites; grep logs
      for `Authorization`, `password=`, `eyJ` (JWT), card-number patterns —
      zero hits.
- [ ] One wide event per request/job exists with outcome, duration breakdown,
      and business context; it fires on exceptions too.
- [ ] No per-item INFO logging in loops/batch jobs; hot-path DEBUG is sampled
      or disabled in prod.
- [ ] Sampling never drops errors or splits a request's logs; audit/security
      logs are unsampled on a separate stream.
- [ ] Log volume/cost reviewed; top producers known; retention set per
      stream; health-check traffic not logged.
- [ ] Exception serialization scrubbed (no connection strings/tokens in
      messages or stack locals).
- [ ] (**Medium**) Every log-emitting host and collector syncs time and drift
      is alerted (`node_timex_sync_status == 0` or an offset threshold);
      clients and edge devices carry a received/observed timestamp beside
      their own (§1). Probe for sync being switched off:
      `grep -rnE 'systemctl[[:space:]]+(disable|mask|stop)[[:space:]]+(--now[[:space:]]+)?(chronyd?|systemd-timesyncd|ntpd?)([^[:alnum:]_-]|$)|timedatectl[[:space:]]+set-ntp[[:space:]]+(false|no|0|off)' .`
      — every hit is a finding unless the host takes time another way.
- [ ] (**High**) Attacker-triggerable log volume is rate-limited per
      source/key, queues and disk are capped, shedding drops DEBUG before
      security events and is counted; sink-down, disk-full, no-permission and
      logger-throws cases are tested (§6a). Probe for unbounded log queues
      (review which ones feed a `QueueHandler`):
      `grep -rnE 'Queue\([[:space:]]*((maxsize[[:space:]]*=[[:space:]]*)?(-[0-9]+|0))?[[:space:]]*\)' --include='*.py' .`
- [ ] (**High**) No filter drops security/audit events by User-Agent, source
      IP or "known scanner/monitor" identity; such actors are tagged instead
      (§7). Probe in pipeline configs and logging code — a hit on the
      operational stream is fine, a hit on the security stream is the finding:
      `grep -rniE '(exclude|drop|filter|skip|ignore).*(user.?agent|kube-probe|healthchecker|pingdom|uptimerobot|scanner|pentest)|(user.?agent|kube-probe|healthchecker|pingdom|uptimerobot|scanner|pentest).*(exclude|drop|skip|ignore)' .`
      That probe misses the Collector `filter` processor's condition-list
      form, where the drop is a bare list item; run this too (hits under a
      `filter` processor are the finding):
      `grep -rniE '^[[:space:]]*-[[:space:]]*.?(IsMatch|not |[a-z_.]*attributes\[)[^#]*(user.?agent|kube-probe|healthchecker|pingdom|uptimerobot|scanner|pentest)' --include='*.y*ml' .`
- [ ] (**Medium**) Events that are emitted late (queue consumers, offline
      clients, uploads, replays) carry the time the action happened, with the
      emit/receive time as a separate field; no pipeline overwrites event time
      with receive time (§1). Probe Collector configs — a hit without a
      `where` guard is the finding:
      `grep -rnE 'set\([[:space:]]*(log\.)?time(_unix_nano)?[[:space:]]*,[[:space:]]*(log\.)?observed_time(_unix_nano)?[[:space:]]*\)[^w]*$' --include='*.y*ml' .`
- [ ] (**High**) The security/audit logger cannot be silenced by a level
      change; runtime level changes go through an approved or auto-reverting
      path and the running level is checked on a schedule (§2). Probe for
      audit/security loggers (or root) set to OFF/ERROR/FATAL in Spring or
      Log4j2 properties (YAML config needs a separate read):
      `grep -rniE '(logging\.level\.(root|[[:alnum:]_.-]*(audit|security)[[:alnum:]_.-]*)|logger\.[[:alnum:]_.-]*(audit|security)[[:alnum:]_.-]*)[[:space:]]*[=:][[:space:]]*"?(off|error|fatal)' .`
- [ ] (**High**) Reads of the log store are themselves logged and read
      access is reviewed on a schedule; file logs sit on their own volume, not
      world-readable; shipment across untrusted networks is TLS with
      verification, and sources are authenticated where events drive
      decisions (§8). Probes — exporter TLS disabled or unverified, then log
      paths made world-readable:
      `grep -rnE '^[[:space:]]*insecure(_skip_verify)?:[[:space:]]*true' --include='*.y*ml' .`
      `grep -rnE 'chmod[[:space:]]+(-R[[:space:]]+)?[0-7]?[0-7][0-7][4-7][[:space:]]+[^[:space:]]*log' .`
