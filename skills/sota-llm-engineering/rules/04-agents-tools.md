# Rules 04 — Agents & Tool Use

An agent is a loop where the model decides what happens next. That autonomy is
the value and the entire risk surface: cost, latency, and failure modes all
become open-ended unless you bound them in the harness. The harness — not the
prompt — owns budgets, stopping, authorization, and observability.

Security split: tool-call authorization, prompt-injection-resistant design,
and the lethal trifecta are sota-code-security rules/08; executing agent code
in isolation is sota-sandboxing rules/05. This file owns build quality.

## 1. Workflow first, agent when earned

**Deterministic orchestration first.** If you can draw the flowchart, write
the flowchart — code-orchestrated steps with LLM calls at the nodes
(classify → route → extract → render). Workflows are cheaper, faster,
debuggable, and evaluable per-step. The escalation ladder (each step only
when the eval shows the previous failing):

1. Single call → 2. structured output → 3. workflow (chain/router/
   parallel-fan-out in code) → 4. single agent with tools → 5. multi-agent.

Gate for tiers 4–5 — all four must hold, otherwise stay at 3:

- **Complexity:** the path genuinely can't be enumerated in advance.
- **Value:** the outcome justifies 10–100× the tokens of a workflow.
- **Viability:** current models demonstrably handle this task class (eval).
- **Cost of error:** failures are detectable and recoverable (tests, review,
  rollback) — or gated by a human (§6).

Audit heuristic: an "agent" whose traces show the same 3 tools in the same
order every run is a workflow paying agent overhead — refactor (Medium).

## 2. Tool design

Tools are the API you publish to a very literal consumer. Most agent failures
are tool-design failures, not model failures.

```json
// GOOD
{
  "name": "search_orders",
  "description": "Search the customer's own orders by status and date range. Call this when the user asks about order status, history, or delivery dates. Returns at most `limit` orders, newest first. Returns an empty list when nothing matches — that means the customer has no such orders; do not retry with the same arguments.",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "status": {"type": "string", "enum": ["pending", "shipped", "delivered", "cancelled"]},
      "placed_after": {"type": "string", "format": "date", "description": "ISO date, e.g. 2026-01-31"},
      "limit": {"type": "integer", "description": "1-20, default 5"}
    },
    "required": ["status"],
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}

// BAD
{ "name": "query", "description": "Run a query",
  "input_schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"q": {"type": "string"}}} }
```

- **Descriptions say *when* to call, not just what it does.** Current frontier
  models reach for tools conservatively; trigger conditions in the
  description ("call this when…") measurably lift correct-call rate
  (verified provider guidance, 2026). Also state what the output means and
  what NOT to do (no-retry conditions, limits).
- **Narrow scope:** `search_orders(customer_scoped)` over `run_sql(string)`.
  Broad tools (bash, SQL, generic HTTP) give leverage but make gating,
  auditing, and parallelizing impossible — promote an action to a dedicated
  tool when you need to gate it (§6), validate it, render it, or mark it
  parallel-safe. Server-side scoping (tenant from session, not from model
  args) is the security half — sota-code-security rules/08.
- **Strict schemas:** enums, formats, `additionalProperties: false`, examples
  in descriptions; use provider strict/validated tool modes where available.
  Validate arguments in code anyway — schema conformance ≠ semantic validity.
- **Idempotency for anything retried:** loops re-execute on transient
  failure. Mutating tools take an idempotency key (derive from tool-call ID)
  or are safe to re-run; a non-idempotent `send_email`/`charge_card` inside
  a retrying loop is a Critical finding.
- **Errors a model can act on:** return structured, instructive failures —
  `"date must be ISO format (2026-01-31), got '1/31/26'"` not `"Error 422"`
  or a stack trace. Distinguish retryable / fix-your-args / give-up in the
  payload. Empty results return an explicit "no results, don't retry same
  args" message, not `[]` alone.
- **Bound tool output size.** A tool returning 200KB of JSON floods the
  context (rules/02 §2): paginate, summarize, or write-to-file-and-reference.
  Token-cap every tool result in the harness.
- **Few, distinct tools.** Overlapping tools ("search_docs" vs "find_docs")
  cause dithering. Prefer one well-described tool per capability; for large
  tool libraries use provider tool-search/dynamic-loading rather than 80
  schemas in every prompt (cache-aware: append, don't swap — rules/02 §5).
- **A *required* tool call is a harness property, not a prompt sentence.** "You
  MUST call `check_policy` before answering" is disregarded exactly as often as
  any other instruction to a probabilistic interpreter, and it fails silently in
  two directions: the model answers without ever calling the tool, or it narrates
  a call it never made and reasons from the invented result. Neither leaves a
  trace unless you go looking. Make the answer **structurally unreachable**
  without the result — the harness refuses to finalize a turn whose required tool
  has not returned *this run*, and the response is assembled from that payload
  rather than from prose alleging it. Then **count both events** (finalize
  attempts blocked, tool results cited but never returned): a mandatory step
  nobody measures is indistinguishable from one nobody needs. This is the
  *mandatory* twin of sota-code-security rules/14 §3, which covers the
  *prohibitive* direction ("never reveal…", "only call this for admins"); the
  remedy differs, because you cannot fix a **missing step** by removing something
  from the context.

## 3. The loop: stopping conditions and budgets

Every agent loop has, in the harness, ALL of:

```python
class AgentBudget:
    max_iterations: int          # e.g. 15 — hard stop on tool-call rounds
    max_total_tokens: int        # input+output across the whole run
    max_cost_usd: float          # computed from per-model price table
    wall_clock_timeout_s: int    # end-to-end deadline
    max_consecutive_errors: int  # e.g. 3 — same tool failing → abort
    max_repeat_calls: int        # identical (tool, args) → loop detection
```

- **On budget exhaustion, fail loudly and usefully:** persist the partial
  trace, summarize state ("ran out of budget after X; completed A, B;
  remaining C"), surface to user/queue. Silent truncation that presents a
  partial result as complete is a High finding.
- **Loop detection:** identical tool+args repeated, or no state change across
  N iterations → inject a "you are repeating yourself; change approach or
  report blockage" turn once, then abort.
- **Tell the model its budget** where the provider supports it (task-budget
  style parameters) or via prompt ("you have ~N tool calls; prioritize") —
  models wrap up gracefully when they can see the countdown; the harness
  limit stays authoritative.
- **Check `stop_reason` every turn** and handle each value explicitly:
  tool-use → execute; end-of-turn → done; max-tokens → truncated (raise cap
  or split, don't parse the stump), and a context-window stop (Anthropic's
  `model_context_window_exceeded`) is the same truncation; refusal → its own
  path; provider pause/continue signals (Anthropic's `pause_turn`: a
  server-tool loop hit its iteration limit — send the content back) →
  resume per provider docs. An unhandled
  `stop_reason` is an infinite-loop or data-corruption bug waiting.
- Long runs on current frontier models can legitimately take minutes per
  request — plan streaming/async/progress UX rather than raising HTTP
  timeouts forever (rules/05 §3).

### 3a. Goal design — what the loop is allowed to call "done"

§3 bounds how long a loop may run. This bounds what it may count as success: the
failure mode where every budget holds, nothing errors, and the loop confidently
finishes wrong.

- **The done-criterion must be machine-decidable.** "Make it good", "clean this
  up", "improve quality" cannot be settled by a comparator, so the loop either
  never exits or exits arbitrarily. "All N tests green **and** a change-list
  written" can. Read the goal to someone outside the domain: if they cannot run
  one command and say done/not-done, it is not decidable yet.
- **Write the boundary in the same breath as the done-criterion.** A goal states
  what must be true *and* what must not have changed to get there. "All tests
  pass" on its own is a licence to delete the failing test — the model is
  optimizing the metric you actually stated. `Done: suite green. Boundary: no
  test file deleted or weakened, coverage not lowered.` The **pair** is the
  anti-Goodhart mechanism (rules/01 §8); the done-criterion alone is the bait.
- **Prefer reconciliation to assertion.** An exit condition anchored to an
  external fact — a golden sample, an upstream total, a financial tie-out —
  cannot be satisfied by editing the checker. Assertions can: loosen the
  threshold, stub the dependency, swallow the exception. Where both are
  available, reconcile.
- **The judge is not the builder.** Acceptance runs as a separate call with its
  own context, on deterministic rules (exit codes, a diff against a reference, a
  type check) — never "does this look right", and never the agent that produced
  the artifact. The builder must not be able to edit the acceptance criteria; if
  it can, eventually it will.
- **Failure has a floor.** Retry cap N, then escalate to a human carrying the
  accumulated failure reasons. Negative feedback with no damping oscillates: the
  loop burns its budget in place and reports nothing.
- **Front-load every clarification.** A loop will not stop to ask at 03:00; it
  commits a guess and runs it to completion. Settle every ambiguity before launch
  or put it outside the loop's scope.
- **The last switch stays human** for anything whose failure you cannot absorb —
  merging, publishing, moving money, touching production. The loop opens the PR;
  it does not merge it. And the pressure runs opposite to intuition: the more a
  loop rewrites its own rules, prompts or acceptance criteria, the **stricter**
  the human review it needs, because the machine acts faster than any post-hoc
  interception.
- **Record the red before the run, and keep the agent off its own gate.** Run
  the project's checks before a coding agent starts and store which already
  fail (test IDs, lint and type-check counts); judge the result against that
  baseline, so a failure that predates the run is neither claimed as fixed nor
  used to hide a new one. Any agent edit to tests, check or CI configuration,
  or thresholds goes to human review whatever its tier — the PR-side detector
  is sota-testing rules/07 §7.10. OWASP: OWASP DSOMM.

Land it in stages — run it once by hand (which forces you to state exactly how
the judge decides), then as a scripted loop, then on a schedule. Build a loop
only when the task genuinely repeats, verification is automatable, the budget
absorbs it, and the agent has tools that actually run and observe the result;
missing any one, do the task directly. **A repo with no reconciliation baseline
does not get a loop — it gets its errors amplified at machine speed.**

## 4. Human-in-the-loop gates

Consequential actions get code-enforced approval gates — the model proposes,
the harness pauses, a human (or policy engine) approves:

- **Always gate:** irreversible/destructive ops (delete, send-external,
  deploy), money movement, anything touching production data or third
  parties on the user's behalf.
- **Gate shape:** the loop *suspends* on a pending approval (durable state,
  resumable), renders the exact proposed action + args to the approver, and
  resumes with approve/deny + reason fed back to the model (deny reason lets
  it adjust). Provider permission policies / "always ask" tool modes
  implement this server-side where available.
- **Approval is per-action, not per-session.** A blanket "yes to everything
  for an hour" is not a gate. Batch *similar* low-risk actions for one
  review where volume demands it.
- **Tier actions by risk and reversibility, in code.** Each tool (or tool +
  argument pattern) carries a tier; only the lowest — read-only, or provably
  undoable — may auto-approve. An action whose undo path has not been shown
  to work counts as irreversible and needs approval *before* it runs, not a
  review after. The critical tier (money above a limit, production deletes,
  permission grants) needs a second, independent approver.
- **An approval is a record bound to one action.** Store actor, tool,
  target, the normalised arguments (or their hash), approver identity,
  reason, timestamp and expiry; the executor re-checks that the call it is
  about to run matches the record and has not expired, so an approval for
  one argument set cannot be replayed on another. **A timed-out approval is
  a denial** — the pending action is dropped, never run by default. OWASP:
  AISVS 9.6.2; OWASP AI Agent Security cheat sheet; OWASP DSOMM.
- **A run nobody asked for is still a request.** An agent started by a
  schedule, an event, a webhook or its own follow-up plan goes through the
  same tiers and approvals as a user-initiated one — with no human in the
  session, nothing may auto-approve on the grounds that "the user asked". Keep
  an allowlist of what may start each agent (schedules, event types, sources)
  in config, reject every other trigger, and record the trigger on each
  action. Watch trigger patterns — rate, source, time, one agent's action
  firing another's trigger — and hold a consequential action for review when
  its trigger pattern is new. OWASP: AISVS 12.4.1.
- Authorization (can this principal do this at all) is enforced in code
  regardless of approval UX — sota-code-security rules/08; the prompt is never the boundary.

## 5. Context management across turns

Long-running agents die of context bloat: old tool results dominate the
window, costs grow quadratically with history, and quality drops.

- **Within a session:** prune stale tool results (context editing) and/or
  summarize-compact earlier history once past a threshold. Prefer
  provider-native compaction where offered (server-side summarization blocks
  you must echo back — verified Anthropic beta, 2026); else implement
  compaction yourself: summarize all but the last N turns, keep the system
  prompt + task statement + open commitments verbatim. Compaction is lossy —
  eval it (does the agent still complete tasks post-compaction?).
- **Across sessions: memory.** File/store-based memory the agent reads and
  writes (notes, learned preferences, prior decisions). Treat memory as a
  product surface: schema/format guidance in the prompt, size limits,
  expiry/decay, user-visible and erasable where it holds user data
  (rules/06 §5), and protected from poisoning via untrusted content
  (sota-code-security rules/08). Current frontier models measurably improve with an explicit
  memory file + instructions on when to consult/update it — but only if you
  tell them when.
- **Memory admission has a precedence order.** Not everything the agent produced
  is a fact. A conclusion the model reached this session, a summary of its own
  reasoning, or a distilled artifact re-entering as a premise is an *assertion*,
  and admitting it launders a guess into a durable fact that later sessions
  cannot tell from an observation. Tag every entry with its origin — observed
  tool output, user statement, agent inference — and on conflict let the **user's
  correction outrank the agent's earlier assertion**, most recent first. The
  symptom of getting this wrong is a correction that will not stick: the user
  fixes something and the old value returns next session, because a confident
  agent note outranked it. The security half — poisoning by untrusted content,
  cross-user scoping — is sota-code-security rules/08.
- **Memory is state someone can edit behind your back.** Seal every persisted
  entry and saved agent state with a keyed MAC (e.g. HMAC-SHA256, key held
  outside the agent's reach) or a signature, verify it on every load, and
  drop and alert on an entry that fails — a bare hash protects nothing, since
  whoever rewrites the entry rewrites the hash. Redact secrets and personal
  data before the write (rules/06 §5), encrypt the store at rest, version it
  so a poisoned store rolls back to a known-good snapshot, and schedule review
  or reset of long-lived memory. **Check each write against what is stored**:
  an entry that contradicts a stored fact on the same subject is flagged and
  resolved by the precedence order above, never appended beside it, and an
  untrusted-origin entry contradicting a user-stated one raises an alert.
  OWASP: AISVS 8.2.5, 9.4.4; OWASP AI Agent Security cheat sheet; OWASP DSOMM.
- **Don't resend what you can reference:** large artifacts go to files/object
  storage with a read tool, not pasted into every turn.
- Cache-aware: history is append-only with a stable prefix (rules/02 §5);
  compaction events are natural cache-rebuild points — don't also swap tools
  or models there.

## 6. MCP integration

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the de-facto open standard for tool/context
servers. **Verified 2026-09-26:** revision **2026-07-28** is the one the spec's
versioning page marks *current* (re-check at modelcontextprotocol.io/specification);
against **2025-11-25** it makes breaking changes (stateless core with no `initialize`
handshake, Tasks moved to an official extension, an Extensions field, a formal
deprecation policy, and authorization hardening: Client ID Metadata Documents as the
SHOULD registration path, Dynamic Client Registration deprecated, RFC 9207 `iss`
validation — identity side in identity and access-management guidance). Engineering
consequences:

- **Pin the protocol revision** you build against and plan the move from
  2025-11-25 to 2026-07-28 — don't hand-roll protocol handling; use maintained
  official SDKs that absorb revision churn. 2026-07-28 deprecates the Roots,
  Sampling, and Logging features (removal eligible from the first revision on or
  after 2027-07-28) and removes protocol-level sessions and the `Mcp-Session-Id`
  header — new servers shouldn't adopt those features or depend on session state.
- **Treat third-party MCP servers as untrusted dependencies:** version-pin,
  review tool descriptions before exposing them to your model (description
  text is prompt input — injection surface, sota-code-security rules/08), and apply your own
  allowlist/gating layer over their tools rather than mounting everything.
- **Your own tools don't have to be MCP.** In-process tool definitions are
  simpler, faster, and easier to test; MCP earns its overhead when you need
  cross-app reuse, third-party integration, or a marketplace of servers.
- The same tool-design rules (§2) apply verbatim to MCP tool definitions —
  most public MCP servers ship vague descriptions and unbounded outputs;
  wrap or fix them before production.
- Credentials for MCP servers belong in a secrets/vault layer, never in
  prompts or agent-visible config. Request the
  **narrowest scope per server** (`mail.readonly`, not `mail.full`) and prefer
  short-lived tokens over long-lived PATs. Environment variables in the
  client's server definition are not that layer either — they sit in a
  config file and are inherited by every child the server spawns; have the
  server fetch its secret from the vault or a mounted secret file at start.
  OAuth access and refresh tokens that a local client or agent tool holds go
  in the OS credential store (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager,
  Secret Service on Linux; Python's `keyring` wraps all three); a `0600`
  plaintext file is a documented fallback only where no keystore exists. The
  authorization spec (2026-07-28, as in 2025-11-25) requires clients and servers to implement
  secure token storage. OWASP: OWASP MCP Security cheat sheet.
- **A server keeps nothing it was handed.** Verified against the MCP
  authorization spec (2026-07-28, as in 2025-11-25): a server MUST accept only tokens issued
  for itself and MUST NOT pass the client's token through to upstream APIs
  — it obtains its own. Beyond that, do not write received tokens or
  credentials to disk, logs or caches, and delete per-session temp files,
  caches and state when the session ends. Filter `tools/list` by the
  caller's scopes so a client never sees tools it cannot call. On the client
  side, enforce a pinned minimum revision rather than accepting any
  downgrade. Under 2026-07-28 there is no `initialize` handshake: every
  request carries its version in `_meta` (and the `MCP-Protocol-Version`
  header on HTTP), a server that does not support it answers
  `UnsupportedProtocolVersionError` (`-32022`) listing what it does support,
  and the client SHOULD retry with a mutually supported one — retry only with
  versions at or above your minimum. Keep the legacy `initialize` fallback
  (for 2025-11-25-and-earlier servers, where a client SHOULD disconnect on a
  version it does not support) off unless you deliberately serve those
  servers. OWASP: AISVS
  10.2.3, 10.2.4, 10.2.6, 10.3.4; OWASP MCP Security cheat sheet.
- **When you operate/self-host an MCP server, harden the server,
  not just the client** (OWASP MCP Security): bind local HTTP/SSE transports to
  `127.0.0.1`, not `0.0.0.0`; **validate the `Origin`/`Host` header on every
  request** to block DNS-rebinding from a browser tab; where a server still
  issues session IDs (legacy revisions up to 2025-11-25 — 2026-07-28 removed
  protocol sessions, and a server on it neither mints nor echoes
  `Mcp-Session-Id`), or hands out any state handle of its own, make it
  non-guessable and bound to user context (`<user_id>:<session_id>`), never a
  bare sequence;
  put remote servers behind TLS with verified server identity and auth. An
  unauthenticated MCP server on `0.0.0.0` is an open tool-execution endpoint.
  **Pick the transport by who must reach the server.** One local client →
  stdio: the client launches the server as a subprocess, no port opens, and
  nothing else can connect. The spec tells stdio servers to take credentials
  from the environment rather than its OAuth flow, so the vault rule above
  still applies. stdio has no authentication of its own, so it never serves
  several users or hosts; shared or remote servers use Streamable HTTP with
  auth and TLS, and loopback binding is the rule for local HTTP only. OWASP:
  AISVS 10.3.2; OWASP MCP Security cheat sheet.

## 7. Multi-agent: patterns and their real costs

Multi-agent is tier 5 for a reason. Costs that proposals systematically
ignore: token multiplication (each agent re-carries context — orchestrator+
subagent systems commonly burn ~10–15× a single chat's tokens), inter-agent
information loss (agents communicate by lossy summary), debugging across N
interleaved traces, and eval complexity (judge trajectories and handoffs,
not just final output).

Patterns that earn their cost:

- **Orchestrator → parallel subagents** for *independent* subtasks (read 30
  files, research 5 competitors): subagents fan out with clean, scoped
  contexts, return summaries; orchestrator keeps the main thread. This is
  the dominant legitimate pattern — it's about context isolation and
  parallelism, not role-play.
- **Generator → critic/verifier** with a *fresh-context* verifier: separate
  context genuinely de-anchors review (a self-critiquing single agent
  doesn't). Cap revision rounds.
- **Cheap-model subagents under an expensive orchestrator** for mechanical
  legwork (rules/05 §1 routing applies per-agent).
- **Partition before you fan out.** N agents pointed at one target with one
  instruction do not give you N chances — they give you **one chance N times**,
  because they converge on whatever is most salient. The pattern that works
  spends a cheap **recon pass proposing the partition first** ("here are N
  distinct input-parsing subsystems worth attacking separately"), then hands each
  agent one partition; Anthropic's defending-code reference harness does exactly
  this, *"so that parallel find agents explore different areas instead of
  converging on the same bug."* Skip it and the fan-out multiplies cost while
  duplicating coverage — and the duplication is **invisible in the output**,
  because N agents reporting the same finding reads as corroboration rather than
  as N-1 wasted agents.

Anti-patterns (findings): role-play committees ("PM-agent talks to
Dev-agent") replicating org charts instead of isolating contexts; depth>1
delegation trees nobody can trace; agents sharing no state but expected to
agree; multi-agent where one good prompt + workflow scores the same on the
eval. Subagent results are inputs to the orchestrator — validate them like
tool output; budgets (§3) apply **per-agent and per-tree** (a parent's
budget bounds the sum of its children). Budgets cap the total; they do not
notice a hijacked agent working inside them. Give each agent and each tool a
**circuit breaker that trips on anomaly, not only on errors** — a call rate far
above that agent's baseline, a first call to a tool or host it has never used,
a burst of denials. An open breaker pauses that agent and returns a structured
"unavailable" to its caller, so one agent's failure does not cascade through
its peers; the containment ladder is sota-sandboxing rules/05 R4.5. OWASP:
OWASP AI Agent Security cheat sheet; OWASP RAG Security cheat sheet.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Parallel fan-out is **partitioned before it is launched** (a recon pass
      assigns each agent a distinct area), and duplicate findings across agents are
      counted as wasted work rather than read as corroboration (§7).
- [ ] Escalation ladder respected: no agent where a workflow's eval scores
      match; no multi-agent without measured single-agent failure; the four
      §1 gates documented for every agent in the system.
- [ ] Every tool: when-to-call description, strict schema
      (`additionalProperties: false`, enums), bounded output size,
      structured actionable errors, explicit empty-result semantics.
- [ ] Every **required** tool call enforced in the harness, not asserted in the
      prompt — the turn cannot finalize without the result this run, and both
      blocked finalizes and cited-but-never-returned results are counted (§2).
- [ ] Any autonomous loop has a **machine-decidable done-criterion with its
      boundary stated alongside it**, an exit anchored to reconciliation where one
      exists, a judge separate from the builder that the builder cannot edit, a
      retry cap that escalates, and a human holding the last switch (§3a).
- [ ] Memory entries carry **provenance**, agent inferences are not admitted as
      observations, and a user correction outranks the agent's earlier
      assertion on conflict (§5).
- [ ] Persisted memory and agent state sealed with a keyed MAC or signature,
      verified on load (fail → drop + alert); secrets/PII redacted before the
      write; store encrypted, versioned for rollback, reviewed or reset on a
      schedule; writes checked for contradiction with stored facts (§5).
      **High**. Probe — memory writes with no seal on the line:
      `grep -rnE '(memory|memories|agent_state)[A-Za-z_]*\.(write|save|put|add|store)\(' . | grep -viE 'hmac|sign|seal'`
- [ ] Scheduled, event-driven and self-initiated agent runs pass a trigger
      allowlist and the same risk tiers as user requests, trigger recorded per
      action, novel trigger patterns held for review (§4). **High**. Probe —
      agent entry points on a scheduler or bus with no trigger check:
      `grep -rniE '(cron|schedule|add_job|on_event|subscribe).{0,60}agent' . | grep -viE 'trigger_polic|allowed_trigger|authori[sz]e_trigger'`
- [ ] Coding agents: failing checks recorded before the run and the result
      judged against that baseline; agent edits to tests, check/CI config or
      thresholds routed to human review (§3a; detector in sota-testing
      rules/07 §7.10). **High**.
- [ ] MCP transport matches reach: stdio only for a single local client,
      never to share a server; shared/remote servers on authenticated HTTP
      with TLS (§6). OAuth tokens held by local clients in the OS credential
      store, a `0600` file only as a documented fallback. **High** for a
      plaintext token file. Probe — tokens serialized to disk:
      `grep -rnE '(refresh_token|access_token)' . | grep -E 'json\.dump|write_text|writeFile|\.write\('`
- [ ] Per-agent and per-tool circuit breakers trip on anomaly (rate spike,
      first-seen tool or host, denial burst), pause the agent and return a
      structured "unavailable" to its caller (§7). **Medium**.
- [ ] Mutating tools idempotent or idempotency-keyed; no non-idempotent
      side effects inside a retrying loop.
- [ ] Harness enforces ALL budget dimensions (iterations, tokens, cost,
      wall-clock, consecutive-error, repeat-call) with loud, state-
      preserving failure — grep every loop for its bound.
- [ ] `stop_reason` exhaustively handled; truncated output never parsed as
      complete.
- [ ] Consequential actions behind per-action human/policy gates that
      suspend durably and feed deny-reasons back; authorization additionally
      code-enforced (sota-code-security rules/08).
- [ ] Actions tiered by risk and reversibility; only the lowest tier
      auto-approves; critical tier needs a second approver; approvals bound
      to actor/tool/target/normalised args with expiry and approver, and a
      timeout denies (§4). **High** (Critical when a timeout executes).
      Probe — approve-on-timeout or blanket auto-approve settings, in code
      (`=`) and in YAML/JSON config (`:`, quoted keys, an allowlist array):
      `grep -rniE "(on_timeout|timeout_action)[\"']?[[:space:]]*[:=][[:space:]]*[\"']?(approve|allow|proceed|true)|auto_?approve[\"']?[[:space:]]*[:=][[:space:]]*(true|\[[[:space:]]*[\"'])" .`
- [ ] MCP servers: no token passthrough, no stored client credentials,
      per-session cleanup, scope-filtered `tools/list`, secrets fetched
      from a vault not set as env values; clients enforce a minimum protocol
      revision (§6). **Critical** for a literal credential in a server
      definition. Probe (`PAT` only as a whole `_`-delimited word, so `PATH`,
      `PYTHONPATH` and `CLASSPATH` stay quiet): `grep -rnE '"([A-Z0-9_]*(TOKEN|KEY|SECRET|PASSWORD)[A-Z0-9_]*|([A-Z0-9]+_)*PAT(_[A-Z0-9]+)*)"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"[^"$]{8,}"' .`
- [ ] Context management present for long sessions: pruning/compaction with
      eval coverage, memory with limits/expiry/erasability, artifacts by
      reference not by paste.
- [ ] MCP: protocol revision pinned (2025-11-25 servers have a tracked migration
      to 2026-07-28), official SDKs used, third-party servers version-pinned with
      reviewed descriptions and an own gating layer; MCP credentials in a
      vault.
- [ ] Multi-agent: pattern is context-isolation/parallelism or fresh-context
      verification — not role-play; token multiplication estimated and
      accepted; per-tree budgets; subagent output validated; traces
      reconstructable per agent.
