# Rules 05 — Production Engineering

The model is a remote dependency with variable latency, hard rate limits,
per-token billing, scheduled deprecations, and behavior that changes between
versions. Engineer around it like you would any unreliable, expensive,
versioned upstream — plus tracing rich enough to debug nondeterminism.

## 1. Model selection & routing

**Select per task on your eval (rules/01), not per vibe or leaderboard.**
Providers ship capability tiers with roughly an order-of-magnitude price
spread between frontier and small models (Anthropic's largest and smallest
current tiers differ 10× on both input and output, as of 2026-09-26; OpenAI
and Google tier similarly). Prices move — newer models have launched
cheaper than their predecessors, and a scheduled rise has been cancelled —
so this file carries no per-tier figures: read them from each provider's
pricing page (e.g. platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/pricing) when
you encode them.
Tokenizers also change between model generations — the same text can
tokenize to ~30% more tokens on a newer model (per Anthropic's pricing page,
for its models from 4.7 on) — so cost estimates built from a price table
must re-baseline token counts per model, not just prices. The pattern,
stable across providers: **frontier tier**
for hard reasoning/agentic work, **mid tier** for most production volume,
**small/fast tier** for classification, routing, extraction, and judges.

- **Right-size empirically:** run the eval suite on the candidate tier below
  your current one; if scores hold, take the savings. Most production
  traffic is over-modeled.
- **Routing:** route by *route/feature* first (each endpoint pins its
  eval-justified model in config); dynamic per-request difficulty routing
  (cheap classifier → escalate hard cases) only when volume justifies its
  own eval + maintenance.
- **Pin model IDs; keep them in config, never inline.** One model registry
  per codebase mapping `task → {model, params, prompt_version}`. Aliases
  that auto-track "latest" are for dev only (§7).
- **Provider abstraction caution:** a thin internal gateway (one module that
  owns auth, retries, tracing, budgets) is mandatory; a *lowest-common-
  denominator* abstraction layer that hides provider-native capabilities
  (prompt caching, structured outputs, server-side tools, batch) is a trap —
  you pay the abstraction tax and lose the features that dominate cost and
  quality. Abstract the operational envelope, not the request semantics.
  Heavy frameworks earn inclusion only if you'd accept them as a normal
  dependency: pin versions, read the code you ship.
- **Fallback chains:** for each route, a configured fallback (usually same
  provider's adjacent tier, or a second provider if you're dual-homed) used
  on outage/overload — switched by the gateway, recorded in traces, and
  *eval-tested in advance* so degraded ≠ broken. Cross-provider fallback
  requires prompt/param compatibility testing per provider — don't assume.

## 2. Rate limits, retries, and errors

Verified error semantics (Anthropic, 2026-09-26, platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/errors
and /api/rate-limits; OpenAI/Gemini analogous in shape — check their tables):
`429 rate_limit_error` (RPM/input-TPM/output-TPM exceeded — read `retry-after`
and the `anthropic-ratelimit-*` headers; a 429 **with no `retry-after`** can be
a tier spend cap, which keeps failing until access resumes — trip the breaker
and page, don't retry), `500 api_error`, `504 timeout_error` (retryable; stream
long requests instead), `529 overloaded_error` (capacity — retryable),
`409 conflict_error` (resolve the conflict, then retry), `413
request_too_large` and the rest of the `400` family (NOT retryable — fix the
request; a spend limit you set yourself also answers `400`), `401/402/403`
(credentials, billing, permissions — page, don't retry).

- **Retry policy:** exponential backoff with full jitter, honoring
  `retry-after` when present; retry 429 (with `retry-after`)/500/504/529 and
  transport timeouts; never retry other 4xx (408 aside, and 409 only after the
  conflict is resolved); cap attempts (3–5) and total elapsed
  time. Official SDKs do this out of the box (e.g. `max_retries` defaults) —
  prefer SDK retry config over hand-rolled loops; hand-rolled string-matching
  on error messages instead of typed exception classes is a Medium finding.
- **Idempotency:** any retried call that triggers side effects (via tools or
  downstream writes) needs idempotency keys (rules/04 §2).
- **Client-side throttling:** track your TPM/RPM budget and queue/shed
  *before* the provider 429s you; spread batch-ish traffic; per-tenant
  fairness limits so one tenant can't starve the org's quota.
- **Streaming requests need stream-aware timeouts** (time-to-first-token and
  inter-chunk idle timeouts), not one giant request timeout. Long
  non-streaming generations will hit HTTP timeouts — stream anything that
  can exceed ~1 minute.

## 3. Latency engineering

Order of leverage:

1. **Stream by default** for user-facing text — perceived latency is
   time-to-first-token; stream tool-use/agent progress too (status events),
   not just final text.
2. **Prompt caching** (rules/02 §5) — cached prefixes cut both cost and
   TTFT substantially on repeated-prefix traffic; verify hit rates in
   telemetry. Pre-warm caches before traffic bursts where the provider
   supports it.
3. **Parallelize independent calls** — fan out subtasks/retrieval/judges
   concurrently; an orchestrator awaiting sequential calls that share no
   data dependency is free latency.
4. **Right-size the model** — small-tier models are several× faster; route
   latency-critical paths accordingly (§1).
5. **Bound the output** — output tokens dominate generation time; tight
   `max_tokens` + concise-output instructions on latency-sensitive routes.
6. **Speculative/hedged calls** — for strict SLOs, race the same request on
   a faster tier or fire a duplicate after a p95 delay and take the first
   finisher; costs double tokens on the hedged fraction — budget it
   explicitly and only on routes that justify it.
7. Semantic/response caching (serve cached answers to near-duplicate
   queries) helps FAQ-shaped traffic; mind staleness + per-user data leaks
   in the cache key, and evict entries when their sources change
   (rules/03 §7).

## 4. Cost engineering

Cost is a feature requirement with a number, not a postmortem surprise.

- **Budget per feature:** target cost/request and cost/day per route, wired
  into the eval gate (rules/01 §5) and alerting (§5). Estimate as
  `(input_tokens × in_price + output_tokens × out_price)` from the registry's
  price table — and re-verify prices on provider pages when they matter.
- **The big four levers**, in typical order of payoff:
  1. **Prompt caching** — ~90% off cached input on repeated prefixes (more
     on some newer models — the read multiplier is per model);
  2. **Batch APIs** — 50% off for async workloads (verified: Anthropic
     Message Batches −50%, ≤24h turnaround; OpenAI Batch comparable). Any
     offline/nightly/bulk job paying real-time prices is a finding (Low–
     Medium by volume);
  3. **Model right-sizing** (§1);
  4. **Context diet** — token budgets per category (rules/02 §2), bounded
     tool outputs (rules/04 §2), compaction (rules/04 §5), few-shot pruning.
- **Per-unit attribution:** tag every call's cost to feature/tenant/user.
  "The AI bill doubled" must decompose in one query to *which route, which
  tenant, which prompt version*.
- Watch the multipliers: thinking/reasoning tokens bill as output; agent
  loops multiply everything (rules/04 §3 budgets are the cap); retries and
  repair loops compound — trace them.

## 5. Observability

If you can't replay it, you can't debug it. **Trace every call** through the
gateway — no direct provider SDK calls scattered in handlers.

Minimum span fields per LLM call:

```
trace_id / parent_span (ties multi-step pipelines + agent loops together)
model_id (exact version), provider, params (temp/effort/max_tokens)
prompt_version, template_id, feature/route, tenant/user (pseudonymous)
rendered prompt + completion (redacted per rules/06 §5; sampled if volume forces)
input_tokens, output_tokens, cache_read/write_tokens, reasoning_tokens
latency: TTFT + total; stop_reason; error class; retry count; fallback used
cost_usd (computed); tool calls with args/results (size-capped)
eval link: run_id when the trace is sampled into eval sets (rules/01 §7)
```

Use OTel GenAI semantic conventions / an LLM-observability platform
(LangSmith/Braintrust/Arize-class or self-hosted) rather than inventing a
schema — but any structured store beats none. The GenAI conventions are at
status **Development** and now live in their own repository
(`open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-genai`, as of 2026-09-26): attribute
names can still change, so pin the semconv version your instrumentation emits.

**Dashboards + alerts** per route: p50/p95 TTFT & total latency, error and
429 rates, cost/day vs budget, cache hit rate, token percentiles,
refusal/truncation rates, online eval scores & user-feedback rates
(rules/01 §4). Alert on: cost anomaly (>2× daily baseline), 429/5xx spikes,
cache hit-rate collapse, eval-score drops, spike in `stop_reason=max_tokens`
(silent truncation in prod).

**Hallucination and harmful-content rates are time series, not only a CI
result.** An automated evaluator scores a sample of live traffic per route for
ungrounded claims (the rules/03 §7 groundedness check) and for disallowed
content; each rate is a metric with a written threshold. Alert on a single
breach **and** on sustained drift — a rate creeping up for a week never trips
a per-sample alert — and treat either as blocking the next release, like the
safety-tagged CI cases (rules/01 §5). OWASP: AISVS 11.1.5, 12.3.3.

**Retrieval is an access to data — log it as one.** Each retrieval span in
the same trace records the requester identity, the (redacted) query, the
knowledge source queried, and the returned chunk IDs with the ACL metadata
that admitted them, so an incident can replay exactly what a user was shown.
Feed these to the security event stream (security-monitoring guidance)
and alert on: query sequences that sweep the corpus (many near-orthogonal
queries, high distinct-chunk coverage per identity), repeated injection-
shaped inputs from one principal, ACL denials at retrieval, and a shift in
which sources or chunks are being returned. A pipeline stage that fails
raises an error naming the stage and emits an event; it never returns an
empty context and lets the model answer from nothing. OWASP: AISVS 12.1.4;
OWASP RAG Security cheat sheet.

Logging prompts/completions is logging user data: redaction, retention, and
access control per rules/06 §5 and sota-privacy-compliance.

## 6. Graceful degradation

Decide per route, in advance, what happens when the model is slow, down,
overloaded, refusing, or over budget:

- **Degrade in steps:** primary model → fallback model (§1) → cached/
  semantic-cache answer → non-LLM fallback (rule-based, search results,
  template) → honest unavailability ("AI assist is unavailable; here's the
  manual path"). Never an infinite spinner; never a fabricated answer to
  mask an outage.
- **Circuit breakers** around each provider: trip on error-rate/latency
  thresholds, route to the degradation path, half-open probe to recover —
  protects your latency budget and stops retry storms during provider
  incidents.
- **Refusals are a normal outcome** (current frontier models return explicit
  refusal stop-reasons): handle as a product path (rephrase, route to a
  fallback model where appropriate, or surface honestly) — not as a 500.
- **Load shedding:** under quota pressure, shed by priority (background
  jobs → batch queue; interactive traffic first) rather than uniformly
  failing.
- **A kill switch that stops inference, separate from revoking tokens.**
  A control-plane flag the gateway (§1) checks before every model call and
  before delivering any output halts generation for a route or a whole
  feature at once — token revocation stops an agent acting (sota-sandboxing
  rules/05 R4.3), not a model still answering users. Its partner is a
  **warm** non-LLM path (rules, templates, search) deployed and exercised in
  advance, so flipping the switch moves traffic rather than dropping it; a
  fallback first built during the incident is not a fallback. Test the flip
  on a schedule. OWASP: AISVS 9.6.1; OWASP AI-Powered Advertising Systems
  Security cheat sheet.

## 7. Versioning & rollout

Everything that changes behavior is a versioned artifact: model ID, prompt,
params, retrieval config, tool schemas, judge prompts. A change to any of
them follows the same pipeline:

1. **Offline evals pass** (rules/01 §5) against the candidate.
2. **Shadow** (where feasible): run candidate alongside production on
   sampled live traffic, compare offline — zero user exposure; pairwise
   judge old-vs-new (rules/01 §2).
3. **Canary/A-B:** small % of traffic, watch online metrics + sampled
   judges; expand on green.
4. **Rollback is config:** previous model+prompt version stays deployable
   instantly; traces carry versions so incidents attribute cleanly.

- **Pinning vs auto-upgrade:** production pins exact model versions. Silent
  auto-upgrade (floating "latest" aliases) ships an uncontrolled behavior
  change — Critical on consequential routes without a regression gate.
  Providers deprecate models on schedules (months, not years): track
  deprecation announcements, run evals against the successor *early*, and
  migrate deliberately — a forced same-week migration is the failure mode
  pinning must not become. Budget one eval-gated model migration per route
  per ~6 months.
- Model migrations are also **prompt** migrations: newer frontier models
  follow instructions more literally — over-aggressive legacy scaffolding
  ("CRITICAL: ALWAYS…") over-triggers; re-tune per provider migration guides
  and your evals (rules/02 §7). Caches are per-model: expect a cold-cache
  cost/latency blip at cutover.
- They are also **reasoning-config** migrations — the request that worked on
  the old model can be a `400` on the new one. Verified on Anthropic's errors
  and effort pages, 2026-09-26: on several newer models thinking is always on
  and `thinking: {"type": "disabled"}` returns 400; forced tool use
  (`tool_choice` `any`/`tool`) returns 400 on some models — use `auto` with
  strict tool schemas or structured outputs; `thinking` blocks must be passed
  back unmodified in tool loops or the request is rejected; and the **default
  effort differs by model** (one model defaults to `medium` where its
  predecessor defaulted to `high`), so omitting it silently changes cost and
  depth. Keep effort/thinking/`tool_choice` in the model registry (§1), set
  effort explicitly, and run an effort sweep on your evals at each migration.

## 8. Generated media: provenance and likeness

- **Mark what the model made.** Images, audio and video your feature generates
  carry provenance: a C2PA manifest (Content Credentials) is a signed claim
  bound to the asset, whose actions assertion can record the IPTC digital
  source type `trainedAlgorithmicMedia`. Embedded metadata disappears on
  re-encode, so add a soft binding as well — the C2PA spec defines it as a
  fingerprint or invisible watermark used to find the manifest again for an
  asset that lost it. Verified against the C2PA 2.2 specification. OWASP:
  AISVS 7.4.4 (generated media is watermarked).
- **No real person without their documented consent.** Before generating
  content that depicts or imitates the voice of an identifiable real person,
  require a recorded likeness or voice-use authorisation (who, scope, expiry)
  that the request path checks — a prompt filter is not that check (rules/02
  §1). OWASP: OWASP AI-Powered Advertising Systems Security cheat sheet.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] Each route's model chosen by eval evidence; tier-below test performed;
      models/params/prompts in a config registry, none inline; price/limit
      claims in code or docs re-verified, not folklore; token counts
      re-baselined when the model (and its tokenizer) generation changes.
- [ ] Single gateway module owns all provider calls (auth, retries, tracing,
      budgets); no scattered direct SDK calls; abstraction does not mask
      provider-native caching/structured-output/batch features.
- [ ] Retries: jittered exponential backoff, `retry-after` honored, 4xx not
      retried, a 429 without `retry-after` treated as a spend cap (breaker,
      not retry), attempt+elapsed caps, typed error classes; client-side
      throttling and per-tenant fairness before provider 429s.
- [ ] Streaming on user-facing and long-running generations; TTFT and idle
      timeouts; no >1-minute non-streaming calls.
- [ ] Latency levers applied in order (stream, cache, parallelize,
      right-size, bound output) before exotic ones; hedged calls budgeted.
- [ ] Cost: per-route budget + alerting; caching hit-rate verified; offline
      workloads on batch API (−50%); cost attribution to
      feature/tenant/prompt-version queryable.
- [ ] Every call traced with the §5 minimum fields; agent steps share a
      trace; dashboards + the §5 alert set exist; prompt/completion logs
      redacted and retention-controlled.
- [ ] Every retrieval logged with requester, query, source and chunk IDs +
      ACL metadata in the request trace; corpus-sweep, repeated-injection,
      ACL-denial and distribution-shift alerts wired to the security stream;
      a failed stage raises and names itself (§5). **High** for a silent
      empty-context fallback. Probe — exception handlers that swallow into
      an empty result: `grep -rn -A1 -E '^[[:space:]]*except' . | grep -E 'return \[\]|(docs|chunks|context|hits|results) = \[\]'`
- [ ] Per-route degradation ladder defined and tested (fallback model →
      cache → non-LLM → honest unavailability); circuit breakers on
      providers; refusals handled as product paths.
- [ ] Rollouts: eval gate → shadow/canary → expand; instant config rollback;
      no floating "latest" in production; deprecation calendar tracked with
      early successor evals; migration includes prompt re-tuning and a
      reasoning-config check (thinking, `tool_choice`, explicit effort) (§7).
- [ ] Hallucination and harmful-content rates tracked per route as time
      series from an automated evaluator, each with a threshold, alerting on
      breach and on sustained drift (§5). **Medium**.
- [ ] Inference kill switch checked by the gateway before each call and each
      delivery, separate from token revocation, with a warm non-LLM fallback
      exercised on a schedule (§6). **High** on consequential routes.
- [ ] Generated media carries a C2PA manifest plus a soft binding; real-person
      likeness or voice generation gated on a recorded authorisation (§8).
      **High** for unconsented likeness. Probe — media generation with no
      provenance step on the line:
      `grep -rnE 'images\.generate\(|generate_images\(|audio\.speech\.create\(' . | grep -viE 'c2pa|credential|watermark'`
