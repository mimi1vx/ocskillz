# Rules 01 — Evals: the centerpiece of LLM engineering

Evals are to LLM features what tests are to deterministic code — except the
system under test is probabilistic, the dependency changes underneath you, and
"correct" is often graded, not boolean. Every other rules file in this skill
assumes the discipline defined here. If a codebase has LLM calls and no evals,
that is the first and most important finding of any audit.

## 1. Eval-first development

**Write the eval before the feature.** The eval *is* the spec: it forces you
to define what "good" means before you burn days prompt-twiddling against
vibes. The loop is:

1. Collect 20+ representative inputs (real ones where possible — support
   tickets, actual documents, real queries), including hard cases, edge
   cases, and cases where the correct behavior is *refusal or "I don't know"*.
2. Define graded criteria per case (expected output, rubric, or assertions).
3. Build the simplest pipeline that could work; run the eval.
4. Do error analysis (§6); fix the biggest failure class; re-run. Repeat.
5. Gate the merge on the eval (§5). Ship. Sample production into the eval
   set continuously (§7).

```yaml
# GOOD — eval case checked into repo next to the feature (promptfoo-style;
# any harness works: promptfoo, Braintrust, LangSmith, DeepEval, in-house)
- vars:
    ticket: "I was charged twice for my March invoice, order #4521"
  assert:
    - type: is-json
    - type: javascript
      value: output.category === 'billing' && output.priority === 'high'
    - type: llm-rubric
      value: "Summary mentions duplicate charge AND order number 4521"
```

```python
# BAD — "tested" by running it once in a notebook
resp = llm(f"Categorize this ticket: {ticket}")
print(resp)  # "looks right" → shipped
```

**Sizing:** 20–50 cases to start; 100–500 for a mature production feature.
Below 20, scores are noise (one flipped case = 5 points). Weight the set
toward observed failure modes, not what was easy to generate.

**Synthetic data is a bootstrap, not a destination.** LLM-generated cases are
fine to reach v1 coverage; replace them with sampled production data as it
arrives. Mark provenance (`source: synthetic|production|incident`) so you can
track the ratio — an eval set that is still >50% synthetic after months in
production is a Medium finding.

**A classifier that guards the model gets a language column.** An injection or
content classifier (sota-code-security rules/08) scored only on English cases
says nothing about the inputs used to slip past it. Its eval set carries the
same attacks in languages the classifier does not claim to support, in
low-resource languages, in mixed-script or transliterated text, and
machine-translated from known English payloads. Report the catch rate per
language; input in a language scoring below threshold goes to a stricter path
(block or human review) instead of being waved through on the classifier's
pass. OWASP: AISVS 2.2.2.

## 2. Eval types — pick the cheapest grader that captures the criterion

Order of preference (cheapest/most reliable first):

| Type | Use for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Code assertions** | Format, schema validity, length, required/forbidden strings, citations resolve, latency/cost ceilings, classification vs gold label | Deterministic, free, zero judge bias. Always start here — a surprising fraction of "quality" is assertable. |
| **Golden-set exact/fuzzy match** | Extraction, classification, SQL/code with executable check | Execute generated code/SQL against fixtures and compare *results*, not strings. |
| **Rubric scoring (LLM-judge)** | Graded qualities: faithfulness, completeness, tone, helpfulness | Decompose into binary sub-criteria (see below). |
| **Pairwise comparison (LLM-judge)** | A/B between prompts/models when absolute scores are unstable | Judges are far more reliable at "which is better" than "score 1–10". Use for regression decisions; randomize order (position bias). |
| **Human review** | Calibrating judges, high-stakes spot checks, novel failure discovery | Too expensive as the routine grader; indispensable as ground truth. |

**Decompose rubrics into binary checks.** "Rate quality 1–10" produces
incoherent, drift-prone scores. Ask N yes/no questions and aggregate:

```text
# GOOD judge prompt (one binary criterion per call or per structured field)
Does the answer make any claim not supported by the provided context?
Answer with JSON: {"unsupported_claim": true|false, "quote": "<the claim or empty>"}

# BAD judge prompt
Rate this answer's quality from 1 to 10.
```

Force the judge to **quote evidence** — it grounds the verdict and makes
judge errors auditable. Use structured output for the verdict (rules/02).

## 3. LLM-as-judge: validate the judge or don't trust it

An unvalidated judge is a random-ish number generator with a convincing tone.
Before judge scores gate anything:

1. **Label 50–100 outputs by hand** (or with domain experts).
2. **Measure agreement** (raw % and Cohen's κ for class imbalance) between
   judge and humans. Target ≥85–90% agreement on binary criteria; below
   ~75%, fix the judge prompt or drop the criterion.
3. **Inspect disagreements** — they reveal either a bad rubric (humans
   disagree with each other too) or a judge failure mode.
4. **Re-validate when the judge model or judge prompt changes.** A judge
   model upgrade is a metric change; treat it like one.

Known judge biases — design around them:

- **Position bias** (pairwise): judges favor the first answer. Run both
  orderings; a result that flips with order is a tie.
- **Verbosity/style bias**: longer, confident, well-formatted answers score
  higher regardless of correctness. Add explicit rubric language ("length
  and formatting are irrelevant") and assert it during validation.
- **Self-preference**: a model grades its own family's outputs higher. Use a
  different model (or at least a different family) as judge than generator
  where the eval compares providers.
- **Sycophancy to the reference**: if you show the judge a reference answer,
  it anchors; if you don't, it hallucinates a standard. Decide deliberately
  per criterion (faithfulness → show context; format → no reference needed).

Judge calls are LLM calls: pin the judge model version, trace them, and keep
the judge prompt versioned in the repo. A silent judge-model auto-upgrade
invalidates every historical score (High finding).

## 4. Offline vs online evals

**Offline (pre-merge/pre-deploy):** golden sets + assertions + judges, run on
demand and in CI. Deterministic harness: pinned model versions, fixed
seeds/params where supported, retries for transient errors but never silent
re-grading until pass. Sampling parameters are not a determinism switch:
`temperature = 0` never guaranteed identical outputs, and some newer models
reject any non-default `temperature`/`top_p`/`top_k` with a `400` (Anthropic,
from Opus 4.7 on — verified 2026-09-26 in its migration guide) — repeat runs
instead (§8).

**Online (production):** sampled judging of live traffic, user signals
(thumbs, edits, regenerations, abandonment, task completion), canary
comparisons. Online tells you about real distribution; offline tells you
*why* and gates changes. You need both; conflating them ("we monitor thumbs,
that's our eval") is a High finding — thumbs are sparse, biased toward anger,
and arrive too late to gate anything.

Run online judges on a sample (1–10% of traffic, 100% of flagged/escalated
interactions), asynchronously, never in the request path.

## 5. Regression gates in CI

The eval suite must run automatically on every change to prompts, templates,
retrieval config, model IDs, or pipeline code — and block the merge.

```yaml
# GOOD — CI job (provider-agnostic shape)
llm-evals:
  if: changed(prompts/**, src/llm/**, evals/**)
  run: evals run --suite core --output results.json
  gate:
    - pass_rate >= baseline.pass_rate - 0.02   # tolerance for grader noise
    - no_regression_on: [tagged:incident, tagged:safety]   # hard cases never regress
    - p50_cost_per_case <= baseline * 1.2
```

Gate rules that work in practice:

- **Compare to a stored baseline, not an absolute number** — absolute
  thresholds rot as the set grows.
- **A small tolerance band** absorbs judge noise; pair it with a hard zero-
  regression rule on incident-derived and safety-tagged cases.
- **Gate cost and latency too** — a prompt change that doubles tokens "passes"
  quality and fails the budget.
- **Run the suite against model-deprecation candidates** ahead of forced
  migrations, and against any model you intend to switch to (rules/05).
- Keep a `fast` suite (assertions only, minutes) for every PR and a `full`
  suite (judges, larger set) for merge-to-main/nightly if judge cost bites.

Eval results are artifacts: persist run ID, git SHA, model versions, scores
per case. "We can't reproduce last month's score" means you don't have evals,
you have anecdotes.

**A replay harness is not an eval.** Recorded-trace or cassette replay —
re-ingesting captured requests and responses instead of calling the model — is
worth having, but it re-executes nothing, so it tests your pipeline's
determinism (parsing, schema drift, orchestration, tool wiring), not the
system's behavior. Wired into the gate as if it were the suite above, it yields
a CI job that stays green through a prompt rewrite, a model swap, or a
retrieval change, because none of those are on the replayed path — and the
greenness is indistinguishable from the real thing. Declare per suite what is
**live** and what is **replayed**, and apply the falsification question
(`sota/SKILL.md` BUILD step 4): if your quality gate would still pass with the
model endpoint unreachable, it is measuring the harness (`sota-code-security`
rules/10).

## 6. Error analysis discipline

Scores tell you *that* something is wrong; error analysis tells you *what to
do*. This is the highest-leverage activity in LLM engineering and the most
commonly skipped.

- **Read the failures.** Every eval run, open the transcripts of failed
  cases. No dashboard substitutes for reading model output.
- **Open coding → axial coding:** annotate each failure with a free-text
  note, then cluster notes into a failure taxonomy (e.g. `missed-table-data`,
  `wrong-date-format`, `over-refusal`, `retrieval-miss`). Fix the biggest
  cluster first; one targeted fix to the top cluster beats five speculative
  prompt tweaks.
- **Attribute the failure to a pipeline stage** before touching the prompt:
  for RAG, was the right chunk even retrieved (rules/03)? For agents, which
  tool call diverged (rules/04)? Most "prompt problems" are upstream
  data/retrieval problems.
- **Each fixed failure becomes a permanent eval case** tagged with its
  taxonomy label and `source: incident`. The eval set is the institutional
  memory of every bug.

## 7. Production sampling into eval sets

Production is the only honest distribution. Build the loop:

- Sample N traces/day (random + stratified by route/intent) into a review
  queue; promote reviewed cases (with corrected expected output) into the
  golden set.
- Auto-promote every trace behind a user complaint, regeneration, support
  escalation, or incident.
- **De-duplicate and decay**: cap near-duplicate cases, retire cases that no
  longer reflect the product. Date-stamp every case.
- Respect privacy: redact PII before a trace enters the eval repo
  (rules/06, sota-privacy-compliance).

## 8. Metric pitfalls

- **Prove the instrument can *see* the change before you run it.** An eval whose
  treated arm never reads the thing you modified returns `+0.00` — and that null is
  **structural, not a result**, while looking exactly like a real one. Before spending,
  name the file the treatment lives in and show the runner reads it (`grep` the path in
  the runner; diff the two arms' prompts). Field-reported 2026-09-03: a router change was
  nearly measured with a runner that builds its catalogue from each skill's *frontmatter
  description* and never loads the router body — its `+0.00` would have been indistinguishable
  from the real `+0.000` the correct runner later produced. The runner's own docstring said
  which of the two it measured; nobody had read it. **A null is only evidence when the arm
  that produced it could have moved.** The inverse of the same fact is useful on purpose: an
  arm that *cannot* see the treatment is a free negative control for the measurement itself
  (§5) — the difference is entirely whether you chose it deliberately.
- **Contamination:** never tune prompts against the eval set you gate on.
  Maintain a dev set for iteration and a held-out set for gating; refresh
  the held-out set periodically from production. Public benchmark numbers
  (MMLU-style) are marketing, not product evals — frontier models have seen
  them; never select a model for your task on public benchmarks alone.
- **Goodharting the judge:** once a judge gates merges, prompts evolve to
  please the judge (longer, more confident, rubric-keyword-stuffed). Counter
  with periodic human calibration (§3) and pairwise checks against older
  baselines.
- **Aggregate masking:** a flat overall score can hide a new failure class
  offset by an improvement elsewhere. Always report per-tag/per-cluster
  scores alongside the aggregate.
- **Non-determinism denial:** run flaky-graded cases k times and report
  pass^k or mean — a criterion that flips run-to-run at the lowest-variance
  settings the model accepts is telling you the behavior is unstable, which
  is itself a finding about the feature, not the eval.
- **Eval-set overfit via retries:** harnesses that auto-retry until pass
  inflate scores. Retries are for transport errors only.
- **Selection bias — building the set out of what the model got wrong.** Distinct
  from contamination above: that one tunes the *prompt* against the set, this one
  builds the *set* from outcomes. Run a model, keep the cases it failed, and the
  gap you go on to report was guaranteed before either arm ran — you have measured
  your selection. It is tempting precisely when an ageing set stops discriminating
  and the still-failing cases are sitting right there. **Fix the selection rule
  before any model runs, write it where the cases live, and let it reference only
  properties of the case** — recency, domain, difficulty tier, provenance, whether
  the fact is documented — never a score. The tell is an authoring order of
  "run, then choose"; the fix is "choose, then run".

  **Measurement sets and regression cases are different, and only one is poisoned by
  this.** A *measurement* set answers "how big is the gap" — selecting its cases by
  outcome guarantees the answer, so the rule above is absolute there. A *regression*
  case answers "has this specific defect come back", and it exists **because** something
  failed once; that is its whole purpose, the same as a known-bad in a negative-control
  harness. Keep them in separate files or tag them, never average a regression case into
  a reported lift, and say which kind a new case is when you add it. The failure mode is
  the quiet merge: yesterday's regression cases silently become today's benchmark, and
  the score rises because the set remembers what the model got wrong.

### 8.1. A saturated measure is a fact about the instrument, not about the system

**When both arms score at the ceiling, you have learned nothing about the treatment.** A
result of 1.00 with the treatment and 1.00 without is routinely written up as *"no headroom
— the capability is solved"*, and that is a different claim from what was measured, which is
*"this instrument cannot tell these two conditions apart"*. The second claim is about your
eval. Only the first is about your system, and the data does not support it.

The failure is expensive because it **closes the question**. A team that reads 1.00/1.00 as
*solved* stops measuring, publishes the conclusion, and writes down an instruction not to
build another instrument — at which point the belief is self-sealing, because the only thing
that could overturn it is the thing now forbidden.

**Field-measured.** A library of engineering guidance closed its audit-accuracy axis at
+0.00 across **nine** instruments, the precision one reading **1.00 in both arms**, and
recorded *"do not build a tenth — recall and precision are both exhausted."* A tenth was
built on an **external, independently-annotated** benchmark. The lift replicated (a
registered null, so the headline survived), but both arms landed **near chance** on a set
balanced so chance was exactly 0.500. Precision had never been perfect; the in-house
instruments had been too easy to discriminate, and "exhausted" was wrong for **29 days** —
from the axis being declared closed on 2026-08-14 to the external benchmark on 2026-09-12.
(An earlier draft said "four months"; no cited instrument supports that interval, and a
dated span is checkable where a vague one is not.)

What to do instead:

1. **Report the absolute score before the delta.** A delta between two ceilings is not a
   small effect, it is an unmeasured one. State the ceiling and the floor of your scale and
   where both arms sit on it.
2. **Treat ≥0.95 in the control arm as a void condition**, registered in advance, exactly as
   you would register a threshold. The run does not produce a null; it produces *nothing*,
   and it should say so itself.
3. **Make chance a known constant.** Balance the classes by construction so a constant
   answer scores exactly 0.5, rather than inheriting whatever base rate the source data
   happens to have — a 70/30 set hands a lazy strategy 0.70 and flatters it.
4. **Prefer an instrument you did not build** once your own saturate. You authored the
   fixture, the rubric and the difficulty; an externally annotated set removes all three
   degrees of freedom at once, and disagreement with it is a finding rather than an
   embarrassment.
5. **Reach for a harder dependent variable** only after checking the easy one is not simply
   mis-scaled — time-to-find, calibration, or performance on the cases experts disagree on.

**The tell to watch for in your own write-ups:** the phrase *"both arms scored perfectly,
so…"*. Whatever follows that comma is almost always a claim the measurement cannot carry.

## 8a. A completeness rubric cannot tell "correctly declined" from "omitted"

§8's pitfalls are about the *metric*. This is about the **rubric's blind spot**, and it is
the one that produces a confident wrong conclusion rather than a noisy one.

A rubric that scores *"did the output contain requirement 1..N"* assigns the same score —
zero — to an answer that **omitted** the requirements and to one that **correctly refused to
proceed** without an answer it needed. The two are opposite behaviours and the instrument
cannot see the difference.

Measured in one instrumented harness: a guided arm scored
**0.00 against a ten-item rubric** while an unguided control scored 0.40. Reading the
retained artifact, the guided response was a **clarifying question about a
security-relevant ambiguity** — exactly what its guidance prescribes — followed by a table
committing to every other requirement. The rubric scored the pause as ten omissions. A
published claim rested on that 0.00 for several hours.

- **If the arm that should be better scores catastrophically worse, suspect the scoring
  first.** A large negative on the treated arm is far more often an instrument blind spot
  than a real regression; a real regression is usually small and noisy.
- **Retain the artifact, bounded if it must be.** That run stored only `artifact_len`, so a
  cell scoring 0.00 three times with a ~1.2k response could not be diagnosed at all and a
  plausible-but-wrong mechanism stood until the text was kept. **An eval that records a
  symptom and discards the evidence guarantees the explanation will be a guess.**
- **Score the refusal explicitly** where declining is legitimate behaviour: add a rubric item
  for *"asked rather than assumed, and said what it would do either way"*, or the instrument
  punishes the behaviour the system was built to produce.
- **This is not specific to LLM evals.** Any completeness checklist over an artifact that may
  legitimately be incomplete — a partial migration, a spike, a deliberate deferral — has the
  same hole.

## Audit checklist

- [ ] **Can the rubric distinguish "correctly declined" from "omitted"?** (§8a) A
      completeness rubric scores both at zero — measured here, a guided arm scored **0.00**
      for asking a security-relevant clarifying question its own guidance prescribed. If the
      arm that should be better scores catastrophically worse, suspect the scoring first;
      retain the artifact (bounded) so the cell can be diagnosed at all; and add an explicit
      item for declining where declining is legitimate.

- [ ] **No axis closed on a saturating measure** — the absolute score is reported before the delta, a control arm at ≥0.95 is a registered **void** condition rather than a null, chance is a known constant (classes balanced by construction), and an **externally annotated** instrument is preferred once the in-house ones stop discriminating (§8.1)?
- [ ] Before any A/B is run, the treated arm is **shown to read the thing that changed**
      (the runner's source names the path) — a null from an arm blind to the treatment is
      structural, not a result (§8).

- [ ] Every shipped LLM feature has an eval suite in the repo, runnable by one
      documented command. (Absent → High; absent on consequential output with
      no human gate → Critical.)
- [ ] Golden set ≥20 cases, includes hard/edge/refusal cases, provenance
      tagged, not majority-synthetic after months in production.
- [ ] Each case set states **how its cases were chosen**, and that rule cites
      properties of the case rather than any model's score on it. (A set whose
      cases were kept because a model failed them reports its own selection —
      treat a missing or outcome-referencing rule as High.)
- [ ] **Regression cases are separated from measurement cases** — different file or an
      explicit tag — and no reported lift averages the two. A regression case may be
      added because something failed; a measurement case may not.
- [ ] Cheapest-grader rule followed: assertions where assertable; judges only
      for genuinely graded qualities; rubrics decomposed into binary checks
      with quoted evidence.
- [ ] Any LLM-as-judge validated against ≥50 human labels with measured
      agreement; re-validated on judge model/prompt change; judge model
      pinned and traced.
- [ ] Pairwise comparisons run in both orders; verbosity/position bias
      addressed.
- [ ] Evals run automatically in CI on prompt/model/pipeline changes and
      block merge; baselines stored; zero-regression rule on incident/safety
      tags; cost/latency gated alongside quality.
- [ ] Eval runs persisted as artifacts (run ID, SHA, model versions,
      per-case results) and reproducible.
- [ ] Each suite declares what is **live** vs **replayed**, and the quality
      gate fails with the model endpoint unreachable — a replay-only gate
      measures the harness, not the model.
- [ ] Online signal exists (sampled judging and/or user feedback) and is
      distinct from — not a substitute for — offline gates.
- [ ] Error-analysis loop visible in history: failure taxonomy, incident
      cases promoted into the set.
- [ ] Dev set ≠ gating set; no prompt tuning against the held-out set; no
      model selection justified by public benchmarks alone.
- [ ] Injection and content classifiers evaluated per language, including
      unsupported and low-resource languages and translated attacks, with a
      stricter path for languages below threshold (§1). **High** where the
      classifier is the only screen before a tool-holding model.
